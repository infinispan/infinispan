/**
 * This package contains the TreeCache.  For usage, see the TreeCache and

 * This package is intended as a compatibility layer between JBoss Cache and Infinispan, and also
 * as an API for when a tree structure is useful.  In general though, this will not perform as
 * well as the core Infinispan API.
