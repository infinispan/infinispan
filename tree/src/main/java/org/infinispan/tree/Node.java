/**
 * A Node is a {@link Fqn named} logical grouping of data in the {@link TreeCache} API of JBoss {@link Cache}. A node
 * should be used to contain data for a single data record, for example information about a particular person or
 * account.
 * <p/>
 * One purpose of grouping cache data into separate nodes is to minimize transaction locking interference, and increase
 * concurrency.  So for example, when multiple threads or possibly distributed caches are acccessing different accounts
 * simultaneously.
 * <p/>
 * A node has references to its children, parent (each node except the root - defined by {@link Fqn#ROOT} - has a single
 * parent) and data contained within the node (as key/value pairs).  The data access methods are similar to the
 * collections {@link Map} interface, but some are read-only or return copies of the underlying the data.
 * <p/>
