# Security policy

The Infinispan team and community take all security bugs very seriously.
You can find our guidelines here regarding our policy and security disclosure.

## Reporting security issues

Please report any security issues you find in Infinispan to:

    security at infinispan.org

### Why follow this process

Due to the sensitive nature of security bugs, the disclosure process is more constrained than a regular bug.
We appreciate you following these industry accepted guidelines, which gives time for a proper fix and limit the time window of attack.
