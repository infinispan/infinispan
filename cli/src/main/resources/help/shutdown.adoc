:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
shutdown - stops server instances and clusters.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*shutdown server* ['SERVERS']

*shutdown cluster*

*shutdown container*


EXAMPLES
--------
`shutdown server` +
Stops the server to which the CLI is connected.

`shutdown server my_server01` +
Stops the server with hostname `my_server01`.

`shutdown cluster` +
Stops all nodes in the cluster after storing cluster state and persisting entries if there is a cache store.

`shutdown container` +
Stops the data container without terminating the server process. Stores cluster state and persists entries if there is a cache store. Server instances remain running with active endpoints and clustering. REST calls to container resources will result in a 503 Service Unavailable response. The `shutdown container` command is intended for environments, such as Kubernetes, that automate resource lifecycle management. You should always use either the `shutdown server` or `shutdown cluster` command instead.
