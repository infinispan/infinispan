 * The {@link CounterManager} creates, defines and returns counters.
 * <p>
 * It is thread-safe in the way that multiples threads can retrieve/create counters concurrently. If it is the first
 * time a counter is created, other concurrent threads may block until it is properly initialized.
 * <p>
 * A counter can be defined using {@link CounterManager#defineCounter(String, CounterConfiguration)} and {@link
 * CounterManager#isDefined(String)} returns if the counter is defined or not.
 * <p>
 * The counter can be retrieved/created using the {@link CounterManager#getStrongCounter(String)} or {@link
 * CounterManager#getWeakCounter(String)} to return an (un)bounded strong counter or weak counter. The operation will
 * fail if the counter is defined with a different type. For example, define a strong counter {@code "test"} and try to
 * retrieve using the {@code getWeakCounter("test"}.
