/**
 * AsyncCache. This interface is implemented by caches which support asynchronous variants of the various
 * put/get/remove/clear/replace/putAll methods
 *
 * Note that these methods only really make sense if you are using a clustered cache.  I.e., when used in LOCAL mode,
 * these "async" operations offer no benefit whatsoever.  These methods, such as {@link #putAsync(Object, Object)}
 * offer the best of both worlds between a fully synchronous and a fully asynchronous cache in that a
 * {@link CompletableFuture} is returned.  The <tt>CompletableFuture</tt> can then be ignored or thrown away for typical
 * asynchronous behaviour, or queried for synchronous behaviour, which would block until any remote calls complete.
 * Note that all remote calls are, as far as the transport is concerned, synchronous.  This allows you the guarantees
 * that remote calls succeed, while not blocking your application thread unnecessarily.  For example, usage such as
 * the following could benefit from the async operations:
 * <pre>
 *   CompletableFuture f1 = cache.putAsync("key1", "value1");
 *   CompletableFuture f2 = cache.putAsync("key2", "value2");
 *   CompletableFuture f3 = cache.putAsync("key3", "value3");
 *   f1.get();
 *   f2.get();
 *   f3.get();
 * </pre>
 * The net result is behavior similar to synchronous RPC calls in that at the end, you have guarantees that all calls
 * completed successfully, but you have the added benefit that the three calls could happen in parallel.  This is
 * especially advantageous if the cache uses distribution and the three keys map to different cache instances in the
 * cluster.
 * <p>
 * Also, the use of async operations when within a transaction return your local value only, as expected.  A
 * {@link CompletableFuture} is still returned though for API consistency.
 *
 * These methods can have benefit over their sync versions even in LOCAL mode.
 *
