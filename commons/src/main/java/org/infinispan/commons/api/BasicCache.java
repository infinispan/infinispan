/**
 * BasicCache provides the common building block for the two different types of caches that Infinispan provides:
 * embedded and remote.
 * <p>
 * For convenience, BasicCache extends {@link ConcurrentMap} and implements all methods accordingly, although methods like
 * {@link ConcurrentMap#keySet()}, {@link ConcurrentMap#values()} and {@link ConcurrentMap#entrySet()} are expensive
 * (prohibitively so when using a distributed cache) and frequent use of these methods is not recommended.
 * <p>
 * Other methods such as {@link #size()} provide an approximation-only, and should not be relied on for an accurate picture
 * as to the size of the entire, distributed cache.  Remote nodes are <i>not</i> queried and in-fly transactions are not
 * taken into account, even if {@link #size()} is invoked from within such a transaction.
 * <p>
 * Also, like many {@link ConcurrentMap} implementations, BasicCache does not support the use of <tt>null</tt> keys or
 * values.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Unsupported operations</h3>
 * <p>{@link #containsValue(Object)}</p>
