# This workflow builds and tests Infinispan client modules for the 14.0.x branch.
# It runs on pushes and pull requests targeting the 14.0.x branch.
#
# NOTE: This workflow replaces the CI pipelines used on the main branch.
# The 14.0.x branch is too old to be tested with the current CI tools and infrastructure
# used on main, so this simplified workflow provides basic build and test coverage.
