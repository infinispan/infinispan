/**
 * A Hot Rod topology address represents a Hot Rod endpoint that belongs to a Hot Rod cluster. It contains host/port
 * information where the Hot Rod endpoint is listening. To be able to detect crashed members in the cluster and update
 * the Hot Rod topology accordingly, it also contains the corresponding cluster address. Finally, since each cache
 * could potentially be configured with a different hash algorithm, a topology address also contains a collection of
 * per cache hash ids. If virtual nodes are disabled, this collection will have a single hash id element. If virtual
 * nodes are disabled, the collection will have the number of configured virtual nodes as size.
