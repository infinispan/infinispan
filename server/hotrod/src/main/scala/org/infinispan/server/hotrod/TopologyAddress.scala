/**
 * A Hot Rod topology address represents a Hot Rod endpoint that belongs to a Hot Rod cluster. It contains host/port
 * information where the Hot Rod endpoint is listening. To be able to detect crashed members in the cluster and update
 * the Hot Rod topology accordingly, it also contains the corresponding cluster address. Finally, since each cache
 * could potentially be configured with a different hash algorithm, a topology address also contains per cache hash id.
