= Server Configuration Examples

This folder contains configuration examples for different environments.
Open each example configuration with any text editor to view inline comments that describe the configuration.

To start the server with one of the configuration examples, do the following:

. Copy the configuration file to the `$SERVER_HOME/conf` directory.
. Specify the filename with the `-c` argument when you start the server.

For example, start the server with a configuration file named "Authentication.xml":

----
$ bin/server.sh -c Authentication.xml
----
