        <h2>Welcome to the Infinispan Server</h2>
        <p>
            This server provides easy to use <a
                target="info" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>
            access to the Server. See below for usage details.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Configuration</h4>
        <p>
            Out of the box, Infinispan Server will use its default cache defined in
            &lt;ISPN_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
            . To set a custom configuration, modify the configuration file and
            restart Infinispan Server
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note that the REST server only allows interaction with either
            the default cache, named <em><strong>default</strong></em>
            or one of the named caches in the configuration file. This is because
            the REST server starts default and pre-defined caches on startup in
            order to provide a more consistent behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please also note that by default the REST server is protected using BASIC HTTP authentication.
            You should use the provided <strong>add-user.sh</strong> or <strong>add-user.bat</strong> scripts, depending 
            on your platform, to add valid users. Alternatively you can configure the <em><strong>security</strong></em> subsystem 
            for your environment. Refer to the <a target="docs" href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Security+subsystem+configuration">Security</a>
            subsystem documentation for further details.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a target="docs" href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Infinispan+REST+Server">The
                chapter</a> in the community user guide has more details.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Putting data in</h4>
        <p>
            HTTP PUT and POST methods are used to place data in the cache - the
            data being the body of the request (the data can be anything you
            like). It is important that a
            Content-Type
            header is set.
        </p>
        <h6>PUT /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
        <p>
            A PUT request of the above URL form will place the payload (body) in
            the given cache, with the given key (if the cache name is new, it
            will be automatically initialised). For example
            http://someserver/rest/hr/payRoll_3
            (in which case
            hr
            is the cache name, and
            payRoll_3
            is the key). Any existing data will be replaced, and
            Time-To-Live
            and
            Last-Modified
            values will updated (if applicable).
        </p>
        <h6>POST /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
        <p>
            Exactly the same as PUT, only if a value in a cache/key already
            exists, it will return a HTTP
            CONFLICT
            status (and the content will not be updated).
        </p>

        <h6>Headers:</h6>
        <p>The following HTTP headers are supported:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Header Name</th>
                <th>Required?</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Content-Type</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Use <a target="info"  href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">media/mime-types</a>,
                    for example "application/json"
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>timeToLiveSeconds</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>The number of seconds before this entry will automatically
                    be deleted</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>maxIdleTimeSeconds</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>The number of seconds after last usage of this entry when
                    it will automatically be deleted</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>performAsync</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>If true, this will return immediately, and then replicate
                    data to the cluster on its own. Can help with bulk data
                    inserts/large clusters.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>3. Getting data back out</h4>
        <p>HTTP GET and HEAD are used to retrieve data from entries.</p>

        <h6>GET /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
        <p>
            This will return the data found in the given cache name, under the
            given key - as the body of the response. A
            Content-Type
            header will be supplied which matches what the data was inserted as.
            Browsers can use the cache directly of course (e.g., as a <a
                target="info"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            An <a target="info" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETag</a> will be
            returned unique for each entry, as will the
            Last-Modified
            header field indicating the state of the data at the given URL. ETags
            allow browsers (and other clients) to ask for data only in the case
            where it has changed (to save on bandwidth) - this is standard HTTP
            and is honored by Infinispan Server.
        </p>
        <h6>HEAD /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
        <p>The same as GET, only no content is returned (only the header
            fields).</p>

        <h4>4. Removing data</h4>
        Data can be removed at the cache key/element level, or via a whole
        cache name using the HTTP delete method.
        <h6>DELETE /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
        <p>Removes the given key name from the cache.</p>
        <h6>DELETE /rest/{cacheName}</h6>
        <p>Removes ALL the entries in the given cache name (i.e. everything
            from that path down).</p>
        <p>
            OPTIONAL: Set the header
            performAsync
            to
            true
            to return immediately and let the removal happen in the background.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Clients</h4>
        Any HTTP client will do - from any language. See <a
            target="docs" href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Infinispan+REST+Server">here</a>
        for more details.

        <h4>6. Deployment</h4>
        Infinispan Server is a distributed data grid, it shouldn"t matter
        how many or which instance of the Server you access, as long as it is
        part of the Infinispan Server cluster, it will find your data, and
        manage it. You can have as many instances (including the one you are
        looking at) as you need.
