        an integer is identified by a sequence of decimal digits, e.g. 256
    long 
        a long is identified by a sequence of decimal digits suffixed by 'l', e.g. 1000l
    double 
        a double precision number is identified by a floating point number (with optional exponent part) and an optional 'd' suffix, e.g. 3.14
    float 
        a single precision number is identified by a floating point number (with optional exponent part) and an 'f' suffix, e.g. 10.3f

        serialized Java classes can be represented using JSON notation, e.g. {"package.MyClass":{"i":5,"x":null,"b":true}}. Please note that the specified class must be available to the CacheManager's class loader.
