/**
 * The {@link org.infinispan.server.resp.hll.HyperLogLog} magic.
 * <p>
 * The compact representation can track up to 2<sup>64</sup> elements with an accurate cardinality estimation and occupy
 * only 12Kb of memory. At instantiation, is reserved a long array with length {@link #STORE_SIZE}. We use
 * P={@link #HLL_BUCKET_COUNT} bits to identify the bucket and Q={@link #HLL_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ZEROES} bits to count the
 * consecutive zeroes. The Q number is representable with 6 bits. Therefore, a register has a width of 6 bits
 * ({@link #REGISTER_WIDTH}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In C, we could allocate the memory space and manipulate it as we want, but here in Java, we have to do some bit
 * twiddling magic to make the registers fit. In other words, each position in the array uses long with 64 bits, whereas
 * one register uses only 6 bits. Multiple registers are within a single array position or spread across two positions.
 * Some manipulation is necessary to retrieve the correct register value from the array.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The basic idea is that with a 64-bit hash, the first P bits identify the bucket, and the remaining Q bits we use to
 * count the trailing zeroes, and in case all bits are 0, the count is Q + 1. The next step is to update the bucket value
 * if it is smaller than the current count. From the bucket number and some bit-shifting, we identify the register.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Credits</b></p>
 * This implementation takes inspiration from the Redis implementation [1], which is based [2]. The bit-shifting
 * manipulation has some basis in [3], which implements the original algorithm without optimizations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Our cardinality estimation uses the optimizations proposed in [2]. And this is the reason we keep an additional int
 * array. We use this approach as it is the same as Redis uses. This algorithm does not require a bias correction as the
 * Google implementation or the [3]. That is, it does not need empirical data to correct estimations.
