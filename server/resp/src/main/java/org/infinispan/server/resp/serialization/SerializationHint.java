 * Hints the serializer for nested object's type.

 * <p>
 * Nested objects, such as arrays and maps, are nested with many objects. The hint aids the serializer in identifying the
 * type of elements inside the structure. This approach avoids traversing the complete list of serializers in the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The hints only work for 1-level nested objects. Deeply nested or heterogeneous structures utilize an unknown hint and
 * search the registry for a match. There is a distinction between {@link SimpleHint} and {@link KeyValueHint}.
