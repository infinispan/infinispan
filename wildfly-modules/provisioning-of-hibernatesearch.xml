<!--
  We use the WildFly provisioning tool to materialize the Hibernate Search modules as fat-modules
  (copy-module-artifacts=true), as Infinispan currently still prefers to ship a fat zip and will
  need to include these modules, including the related jar files.
  Ideally Infinispan would also just release feature packs, and then just depend on the following
  feature pack definitions.
  Dependencies are being excluded as the `hibernate-search-jbossmodules-engine` depends on the
  feature pack `org.wildfly:wildfly-feature-pack`, which would pull in the whole WildFly server
  into our modules zip.
  Normally the Hibernate Search modules would pull in the Lucene modules transitively, but since
  we exclude dependencies we need to explicitly re-include them.
  Unfortunately this gets the build scripts to require versions to match the lucene feature pack
  version from the Hibernate Search version; in other words when the transition to feature packs
  is complete the property `version.lucene.featurepack`, `version.gson.featurepack` would be
  inherited from the speficied Hibernate Search pack, making maintenance simpler.
