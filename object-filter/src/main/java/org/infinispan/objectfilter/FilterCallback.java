/**
 * A single-method callback that is specified when registering a filter with a Matcher. The {@link #onFilterResult}

 * associated with this callback. The callback will receive the instance being matched, the projected fields (optional,
 * if specified) and the 'order by' projections (optional, if specified). The 'order by' projection is an array of
 * {@link java.lang.Comparable} that can be compared using the {@link java.util.Comparator} provided by {@link
 * FilterSubscription#getComparator()}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are provided by the subscriber and must written is such a way that they can be
 * invoked from multiple threads simultaneously.
