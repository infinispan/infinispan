==  Managing this confluence instance.

 On a minor release we clone this space to a versioned name (e.g. ISPN51), leaving the ISPN space available for development in HEAD. To do this, visit _Browse_ -&gt; _Space Admin_ and choose _Permissions_ and make sure you have _Space Admin_ and _Space Export_ permissions. Then, visit _Copy Space_ , and fill in the name (e.g. Infinispan 5.1) and key (e.g. ISPN51). Make sure all the boxes are checked, and click Save. 

 Finally, you'll need to update the name of the ISPN space to reflect the minor version of the development in HEAD (e.g. Infinispan 5.2). You can do this in _Space Details_ .
