This guide walks you through the process of upgrading Infinispan.

== Upgrading from 6.0 to 7.0
=== API Changes

==== Cache Loader
To be more inline with JCache and java.util.collections interfaces we have changed the first argument type for the CacheLoader.load & CacheLoader.contains methods to be Object from type K.

==== Cache Writer
To be more inline with JCache and java.util.collections interfaces we have changed the first argument type for the CacheWriter.delete method to be Object from type K.

==== Filters

Over time Infinispan added 2 interfaces with identical names and almost identical methods.  The org.infinispan.notifications.KeyFilter and org.infinispan.persistence.spi.AdvancedCacheLoader$KeyFilter interfaces.

Both of these interfaces are used for the sole purpose of filtering an entry by it's given key.  Infinispan 7.0 has also introduced the KeyValueFilter which is similar to both but also can filter on the entries value and/or metadata.

As such all of these classes have been moved into a new package org.infinispan.filter and all of their related helper classes.

The new org.infinispan.filter.KeyFilter interface has replaced both of the previous interfaces and all previous references use the new interface.

== Upgrading from 5.3 to 6.0
=== Declarative configuration
In order to use all of the latest features, make sure you change the namespace declaration at the top of your XML configuration files as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:6.0 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-6.0.xsd" xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:6.0">
   ...
</infinispan>
----

=== Deprecated API removal

* Class `org.infinispan.persistence.remote.wrapperEntryWrapper`.

* Method `ObjectOutput startObjectOutput(OutputStream os, boolean isReentrant)` from class
`org.infinispan.commons.marshall.StreamingMarshaller`.

* Method `CacheEntry getCacheEntry(Object key, EnumSet<Flag> explicitFlags, ClassLoader explicitClassLoader)` from class
`org.infinispan.AdvancedCache`.
Please use instead: `AdvanceCache.withFlags(Flag... flags).with(ClassLoader classLoader).getCacheEntry(K key)`.

* Method `AtomicMap<K, V> getAtomicMap(Cache<MK, ?> cache, MK key, FlagContainer flagContainer)` from class
`org.infinispan.atomic.AtomicMapLookup`.
Please use instead `AtomicMapLookup.getAtomicMap(cache.getAdvancedCache().withFlags(Flag... flags), MK key)`.

* Package `org.infinispan.config` (and all methods involving the old configuration classes).
All methods removed has an overloaded method which receives the new configuration classes as parameters.
Please refer to <<_configuration>> for more information about the new configuration classes.

NOTE: This only affects the programmatic configuration.

* Class `org.infinispan.context.FlagContainer`.

* Method `boolean isLocal(Object key)` from class `org.infinispan.distribution.DistributionManager`.
Please use instead `DistributionManager.getLocality(Object key)`.

* JMX operation `void setStatisticsEnabled(boolean enabled)` from class `org.infinispan.interceptors.TxInterceptor`
Please use instead the `statisticsEnabled` attribute.

* Method `boolean delete(boolean synchronous)` from class `org.infinispan.io.GridFile`.
Please use instead `GridFile.delete()`.

* JMX attribute `long getLocallyInterruptedTransactions()` from class
`org.infinispan.util.concurrent.locks.DeadlockDetectingLockManager`.

==  Upgrading from 5.2 to 5.3
=== Declarative configuration
In order to use all of the latest features, make sure you change the namespace declaration at the top of your XML configuration files as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:5.2 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-5.2.xsd" xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.3">
   ...
</infinispan>
----


== Upgrading from 5.1 to 5.2
=== Declarative configuration
In order to use all of the latest features, make sure you change the namespace declaration at the top of your XML configuration files as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:5.2 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-5.2.xsd" xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.2">
   ...
</infinispan>
----

=== Transaction

The default transaction enlistment model has changed ( link:$$https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1284$$[ISPN-1284] ) from link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/transaction/xa/XAResource.html$$[`XAResource`] to link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/transaction/Synchronization.html$$[`Synchronization`].
Also now, if the `XAResource` enlistment is used, then link:../user_guide/user_guide.html#_transaction_recovery[recovery] is enabled by default.

In practical terms, if you were using the default values, this should not cause any backward compatibility issues but an increase in performance of about 5-7%. However in order to use the old configuration defaults, you need to configure the following:

[source,xml]
----
<transaction useSynchronization="false">
   <recovery enabled="false"/>
</transaction>
----

or the programmatic configuration equivalent:

[source,java]
----
ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
builder.transaction().useSynchronization(false).recovery().enabled(false)
----

=== Cache Loader and Store configuration

Cache Loader and Store configuration has changed greatly in Infinispan 5.2. Please refer to the link:../user_guide/user_guide.html#_cache_loaders_and_stores[Cache Loaders and Stores] documentation. 

=== Virtual Nodes and Segments

The concept of Virtual Nodes doesn't exist anymore in Infinispan 5.2 and has been replaced by Segments. Please refer to the link:../user_guide/user_guide.html#_clustering_modes[Clustering modes] documentation for details.

==  Upgrading from 5.0 to 5.1
=== API

The cache and cache manager hierarchies have changed slightly in 5.1 with the introduction of 
link:$$https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/api/BasicCache.html$$[`BasicCache`]
and 
link:$$https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/api/BasicCacheContainer.html$$[`BasicCacheContainer`]
, which are parent classes of existing 
link:$$https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html$$[`Cache`]
and 
link:$$https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/5.1/apidocs/org/infinispan/CacheContainer.html$$[`CacheContainer`]
classes respectively. What's important is that Hot Rod clients must now code
against `BasicCache` and `BasicCacheContainer` rather than `Cache` and `CacheContainer`.
So previous code that was written like this will no longer compile. 

[source,java]
.WontCompile.java
----
import org.infinispan.Cache;
import org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
CacheContainer cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
Cache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----

Instead, if Hot Rod clients want to continue using interfaces higher up the hierarchy from the remote cache/container classes, they'll have to write:

[source,java]
.Correct.java
----
import org.infinispan.BasicCache;
import org.infinispan.manager.BasicCacheContainer;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
BasicCacheContainer cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
BasicCache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----

However, previous code that interacted against the `RemoteCache` and `RemoteCacheManager` will work as it used to:

[source,java]
.AlsoCorrect.java
----
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCache;
import org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCacheManager;
...
RemoteCacheManager cacheContainer = new RemoteCacheManager();
RemoteCache cache = cacheContainer.getCache();
----

=== Eviction and Expiration

* The eviction XML element no longer defines the `wakeUpInterval` attribute. This is now configured via the `expiration` element: 

[source,xml]
----
<expiration wakeUpInterval="60000"... />
----

Eviction's `maxEntries` is used as guide for the entire cache, but eviction happens on a per cache segment, so when the segment is full, the segment is evicted. That's why `maxEntries` is a theoretical limit but in practical terms, it'll be a bit less than that. This is done for performance reasons.

=== Transactions

* A cache marked as `TRANSACTIONAL` cannot be accessed outside of a transaction, and a `NON_TRANSACTIONAL` cache cannot be accessed within a transaction. In 5.0, a transactional cache would support non-transactional calls as well.  This change was done to be in-line with expectations set out in link:$$https://github.com/jsr107$$[JSR-107] as well as to provide more consistent behavior. 

* In 5.0, commit and rollback phases were asynchronous by default. Starting with 5.1, these are now synchronous by default, to provide the guarantees required by a single lock-owner model.

=== State transfer
One of the big changes we made in 5.1 was to use the same push-based state transfer we introduced in 5.0 both for rehashing in distributed mode and for state retrieval in replicated mode. We even borrow the consistent hash concept in replicated mode to transfer state from all previous cache members at once in order to speed up transfer.

As a consequence we've unified the state transfer configuration as well, there is now a `stateTransfer` element containing a simplified state transfer configuration. The corresponding attributes in the `stateRetrieval` and `hash` elements have been deprecated, as have been some attributes that are no longer used. 

=== Configuration
If you use XML to configure Infinispan, you shouldn't notice any change, except a much faster startup, courtesy of the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX[StAX] based parser. However, if you use programmatic configuration, read on for the important differences.

Configuration is now packaged in `org.infinispan.configuration`, and you must use a fluent, builder style:

[source,java]
----

Configuration c1 = new ConfigurationBuilder()  
   // Adjust any configuration defaults you want  
   .clustering()  
      .l1()  
         .disable()  
      .mode(DIST_SYNC)  
      .hash()  
         .numOwners(5)  
   .build();  

----

* The old javabean style configuration is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version.
* Configuration properties which can be safely changed at runtime are mutable, and all others are immutable.
* To copy a configuration, use the `read()` method on the builder, for example:

[source,java]
----

Configuration c2 = new ConfigurationBuilder()  
   // Read in C1 to provide defaults  
   .read(c1)  
   .clustering()  
      .l1()  
         .enable()  
   // This cache is DIST_SYNC, will have 5 owners, with L1 cache enabled  
   .build();  

----

This completely replaces the old system of defining a set of overrides on bean properties. Note that this means the behaviour of Infinispan configuration is somewhat different when used programmatically. Whilst before, you could define a default configuration, and any overrides would be applied on top of _your_ defaults when defined, now you must explicitly read in your defaults to the builder. This allows for much greater flexibility in your code (you can have a as many "default" configurations as you want), and makes your code more explicit and type safe (finding references works). 

The schema is unchanged from before. Infinispan 4.0 configurations are currently not being parsed. To upgrade, just change the schema definition from:

[source,xml]
----

<infinispan  
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:4.1 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-4.1.xsd"  
     xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:4.1">  

----

to

[source,xml]
----

<infinispan  
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
     xsi:schemaLocation="urn:infinispan:config:5.1 http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-5.1.xsd"  
     xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:5.1">  

----

The schema documentation has changed format, as it is now produced using the standard tool `xsddoc`. This should be a significant improvement, as better navigation is offered. Some elements and attributes are missing docs right now, we are working on adding this. As an added benefit, your IDE should now show documentation when an xsd referenced (as above)

We are in the process of adding in support for this configuration style for modules (such as cache stores). In the meantime, please use the old configuration or XML if you require support for cache store module configuration.

=== Flags and ClassLoaders

The `Flags` and `ClassLoader` API has changed. In the past, the following would work:

[source,java]
----
 cache.withFlags(f1, f2); cache.withClassLoader(cl); cache.put(k, v); 
----

In 5.1.0, these `withX()` methods return a new instance and not the cache itself, so thread locals are avoided and the code above will not work. If used in a fluent manner however, things still work:

[source,java]
----
cache.withFlags(f1, f2).withClassLoader(cl).put(k, v);
----

The above pattern has always been the intention of this API anyway.

=== JGroups Bind Address

Since upgrading to JGroups 3.x, `-Dbind.address` is ignored. This should be replaced with `-Djgroups.bind_addr`.
