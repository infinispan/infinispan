==  Downloading and installing Infinispan

To run the Infinispan, you'll need

* A Java 6.0 JDK
* Maven 3, if you wish to use the quickstart examples or create a new project using the Infinispan link:../getting_started/getting_started.html#_maven_archetypes[archetype] 
* the Infinispan distribution zip, if you wish to use Infinispan in server mode, or want to use the jars in an ant project
* the Infinispan Quickstart zip, if you want to follow along with the projects discussed in the guide

TIP: If you already have any of these pieces of software, there is no need to install them again!

=== JDK
Choose your Java runtime, and follow their installation instructions. For example, you could choose one of:

*  link:$$http://openjdk.java.net/install/$$[OpenJDK] 
*  link:$$http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html$$[Oracle Java SE] 
*  link:$$http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E15289_01/doc.40/e15065/toc.htm$$[Oracle JRockit] 

=== Maven
Follow the official Maven installation guide if you don't already have Maven 3 installed.
You can check which version of Maven you have installed (if any) by running mvn --version . If you see a version newer than 3.0.0, you are ready to go. 

TIP: You can also deploy the examples using your favorite IDE. We provide instructions for using Eclipse only.
