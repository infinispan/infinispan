=== Store Migrator
Infinispan 9.0 introduced non-backwards compatible changes to Infinispan internal marshalling. Consequently, cache stores
created with prior versions of Infinispan can no longer be read by Infinispan 9.x. Furthermore, some previous store
implementations, such as the JDBC Mixed and Binary stores, are no longer provided. Therefore, in order to assist users,
we have created a migration tool `StoreMigrator.java`, that reads data from Infinispan 8.2.x stores and rewrites their
content using the latest marshalling implementation.

==== Usage
The`StoreMigrator` takes a single argument, the path to a
`.properties` file which must contain the configuration properties for both the source and target stores. An example
properties file containing all applicable configuration options can be found
link:https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/tools/src/main/resources/migrator.properties[here].

To use the migrator, you need the `infinispan-tools-{infinispanversion}.jar` as well as any dependencies (e.g. JDBC drivers)
required by your source and target databases on your classpath. An example maven pom, that will execute the migrator
via `mvn exec:java` is presented below:

include::topics/dependencies/persistence_storemigrator.adoc[]

==== Properties
All migrator properties are configured within the context of a source or target store and so each properties must start
with either `source.` or `target.`.  All of the properties listed below are applicable to both source and target stores,
with the exception of `table.binary.*` properties as it is not possible to migrate to a binary table.

The property `*.marshaller.type` denotes whether the marshaller from
{brandname} 8.2x (LEGACY), 9.x (CURRENT) or a custom marshaller should be
utilised. Note, that the LEGACY marshaller can only be specified for the source
store.

===== Common Properties

[options="header"]
|===============
|Property|Description|Example value|Required
|type | JDBC_STRING \| JDBC_BINARY \| JDBC_MIXED \| LEVELDB \| ROCKSDB \| SINGLE_FILE_STORE \| SOFT_INDEX_FILE_STORE | JDBC_MIXED | TRUE
|cache_name | The name of the cache associated with the store | persistentMixedCache | TRUE
//Exclude segmentation support from productized docs.
ifndef::productized[]
|segment_count | How many segments this store will be created with. If not provided store will not be segmented. (supported as target only - JDBC not yet supported) | null
endif::productized[]
|===============

//Exclude segmentation support from productized docs.
ifndef::productized[]
It should be noted that the *segment_count* property should match how many
segments your cache will be using. That is that it should match the
`clustering.hash.numSegments` config value. If these do not match, data
will not be properly read when running the cache.
