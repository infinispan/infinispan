[[CrossSiteReplication]]
== Cross site replication
Cross site (x-site) replication allows backing up the data from one cluster to other clusters, potentially situated in different geographical location. The cross-site replication is built on top of JGroups' link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced$$[RELAY2 protocol] . link:$$https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DesignForCrossSiteReplication$$[This document] describes the technical design of cross site replication in more detail. 

NOTE: Cross site replication needs the backup cache running in the site master node(s) (i.e. node which receives the backup and applies it). The backup cache starts automatically when it receives the first backup request.

=== Sample deployment
The diagram below depicts a possible setup of replicated sites, followed by a description of individual elements present in the deployment. Options are then explained at large in future paragraphs. Comments on the diagram above: 

image::images/xdc.png[]


* there are 3 sites: LON, NYC and SFO.


* in each site there is a running Infinispan cluster with a (potentially) different number of physical nodes: 3 nodes in LON, 4 nodes in NYC and 3 nodes in SFO


* the "users" cache is active in LON, NYC and SFO. Updates on the "users" cache in any of these sites gets replicated to the other sites as well


* it is possible to use different replication mechanisms between sites. E.g. One can configure SFO to backup data synchronously to NYC and asynchronously to LON


* the "users" cache can have a different configuration from one site to the other. E.g. it might be configured as distributed with numOwners=2 in the LON site, REPL in the NYC site and distributed with numOwners=1 in the SFO site


*  JGroups is used for both inter-site and intra-site communication. link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced$$[RELAY2] is used for inter-site communication 


*  "orders" is a site local to LON, i.e. updates to the data in "orders" don't get replicated to the remote sites The following sections discuss specific aspects of cross site replication into more detail. The foundation of the cross-site replication functionality is RELAY2 so it highly recommended to read JGroups' link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced$$[RELAY2] documentation before moving on into cross-site. Configuration 

The cross-site replication configuration spreads over the following files:

.  the backup policy for each individual cache is defined in infinispan's .xml configuration file (link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/cdd5420af764c907e342[infinispan.xml]) 


.  cluster's JGroups xml configuration file: link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced$$[RELAY2] protocol needs to be added to the JGroups protocol stack (link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/409fe5ece5fe4bcf679f[jgroups.xml]) 


.  RELAY2 configuration file: RELAY2 has an own configuration file ( link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/8c7238dae7921d2c883e[relay2.xml] ) 


.  the JGroups channel that is used by RELAY2 has its own configuration file (link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/cbc1a297a367b1176feb[jgroups-relay2.xml]) Infinispan XML configuration file 

The local site is defined in the the global configuration section. The local is the site where the node using this configuration file resides (in the example above local site is "LON").

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----

<transport site="LON" />

----

The same setup can be achieved programatically:

[source,java]
----

GlobalConfigurationBuilder lonGc = GlobalConfigurationBuilder.defaultClusteredBuilder();
lonGc.site().localSite("LON");

----

The names of the site (case sensitive) should match the name of a site as defined within JGroups' RELAY2 protocol configuration file. Besides the global configuration, each cache specifies its backup policy in the "site" element: 

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----

<distributed-cache name="users">
  <backups>
    <backup site="NYC" failure-policy="WARN" strategy="SYNC" timeout="12000"/>
    <backup site="SFO" failure-policy="IGNORE" strategy="ASYNC"/>
    <backup site="LON" strategy="SYNC" enabled="false"/>
  </backups>
</distributed-cache>

----

The "users" cache backups its data to the "NYC" and "SFO" sites. Even though the "LON" appears as a backup site, it has the "enabled" attribute set to _false_ so it will be ignored . For each site backup, the following configuration attributes can be specified: 


* _strategy_ - the strategy used for backing up data, either "SYNC" or "ASYNC". Defaults to "ASYNC"
* _failure-policy_ - Decides what the system would do in case of failure during backup. Possible values are:
** _IGNORE_ - allow the local operation/transaction to succeed
** _WARN_ - same as IGNORE but also logs a warning message. Default.
** _FAIL_ - only in effect if "strategy" is "SYNC" - fails local cluster operation/transaction by throwing an exception to the user
** _CUSTOM_ - user provided, see "failurePolicyClass" below

* failurePolicyClass - If the 'failure-policy' is set to 'CUSTOM' then this attribute is required and should contain the fully qualified name of a class implementing org.infinispan.xsite.CustomFailurePolicy
* timeout - The timeout(milliseconds) to be used when backing up data remotely. Defaults to 10000 (10 seconds)

The same setup can be achieved programatically:

[source,java]
----

ConfigurationBuilder lon = new ConfigurationBuilder();
lon.sites().addBackup()
      .site("NYC")
      .backupFailurePolicy(BackupFailurePolicy.WARN)
      .strategy(BackupConfiguration.BackupStrategy.SYNC)
      .replicationTimeout(12000)
      .sites().addInUseBackupSite("NYC")
    .sites().addBackup()
      .site("SFO")
      .backupFailurePolicy(BackupFailurePolicy.IGNORE)
      .strategy(BackupConfiguration.BackupStrategy.ASYNC)
      .sites().addInUseBackupSite("SFO")

----

The "users" cache above doesn't know on which cache on the remote sites its data is being replicated. By default the remote site writes the backup data to a cache having the same name as the originator, i.e. "users". This behaviour can be overridden with an "backupFor" element. For example the following configuration in SFO makes the "usersLONBackup" cache act as the backup cache for the "users" cache defined above in the LON site:

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----

<infinispan>
  <cache-container default-cache="">
     <distributed-cache name="usersLONBackup">
        <backup-for remote-cache="users" remote-site="LON"/>
     </distributed-cache>
  </cache-container>
</infinispan>

----

The same setup can be achieved programatically:

[source,java]
----

ConfigurationBuilder cb = new ConfigurationBuilder();
cb.sites().backupFor().remoteCache("users").remoteSite("LON");

----

==== Local cluster's jgroups .xml configuration

This is the configuration file for the local (intra-site) infinispan cluster. It is referred from the infinispan configuration file, see "configurationFile" below:

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----
<infinispan>
  <jgroups>
     <stack-file name="external-file" path="jgroups.xml"/>
  </jgroups>
  <cache-container>
    <transport stack="external-file" />
  </cache-container>

  ...

</infinispan>
----

In order to allow inter-site calls, the RELAY2 protocol needs to be added to the protocol stack defined in the jgroups configuration (see attached link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/409fe5ece5fe4bcf679f[jgroups.xml] for an example).

==== RELAY2 configuration file

The RELAY2 configuration file is linked from the jgroups.xml (see attached link:https://gist.github.com/maniksurtani/8c7238dae7921d2c883e[relay2.xml]). It defines the sites seen by this cluster and also the JGroups configuration file that is used by RELAY2 in order to communicate with the remote sites. 

=== Data replication
For both transactional and non-transactional caches, the backup calls are performed in parallel with local cluster calls, e.g. if we write data to node N1 in LON then replication to the local nodes N2 and N3 and remote backup sites SFO and NYC happen in parallel.

==== Non transactional caches
In the case of non-transactional caches the replication happens during each operation. Given that data is sent in parallel to backups and local caches, it is possible for the operations to succeed locally and fail remotely, or the other way, causing inconsistencies

==== Transactional caches
For synchronous transactional caches, Infinispan internally uses a two phase commit protocol: lock acquisition during the 1st phase (prepare) and apply changes during the 2nd phase (commit). For asynchronous caches the two phases are merged, the "apply changes" message being sent asynchronously to the owners of data. This 2PC protocol maps to 2PC received from the JTA transaction manager. For transactional caches, both optimistic and pessimistic, the backup to remote sites happens during the prepare and commit phase only. 

===== Synchronous local cluster with async backup
In this scenario the backup call happens during local commit phase(2nd phase). That means that if the local prepare fails, no remote data is being sent to the remote backup.

===== Synchronous local cluster with sync backup
In this case there are two backup calls:

* during prepare a message is sent across containing all the modifications that happened within this transaction


* if the remote backup cache is transactional then a transaction is started remotely and all these modifications are being written within this transaction's scope. The transaction is not committed yet (see below)


* if the remote backup cache is not transactional, then the changes are applied remotely


* during the commit/rollback, a commit/rollback message is sent across


* if the remote backups cache is transactional then the transaction started at the previous phase is committed/rolled back


* if the remote backup is not transactional then this call is ignored

Both the local and the backup call(if the "backupFailurePolicy" is set to "FAIL") can veto transaction's prepare outcome

===== Asynchronous local cluster
In the case of asynchronous local clusters, the backup data is sent during the commit phase. If the backup call fails and the "backupFailurePolicy" is set to "FAIL" then the user is notified through an exception.

=== Taking a site offline
If backing up to a site fails for a certain number of times during a time interval, then it is possible to automatically mark that site as offline. When a site is marked as offline the local site won't try to backup data to it anymore. In order to be taken online a system administrator intervention being required.

==== Configuration
The taking offline of a site can be configured as follows:

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----

<replicated-cache name="bestEffortBackup">
   ...
   <backups>
     <backup site="NYC" strategy="SYNC" failure-policy="FAIL">
         <take-offline after-failures="500" min-wait="10000"/>
     </backup>
   </backups>
    ...
</replicated-cache>

----

The _take-offline_ element under the _backup_ configures the taking offline of a site:

* _after-failures_ - the number of failed backup operations after which this site should be taken offline. Defaults to 0 (never). A negative value would mean that the site will be taken offline after _minTimeToWait_

* _min-wait_ - the number of milliseconds in which a site is not marked offline even if it is unreachable for 'afterFailures' number of times. If smaller or equal to 0, then only _afterFailures_ is considered.

The equivalent programmatic configuration is:

[source,java]
----

lon.sites().addBackup()
      .site("NYC")
      .backupFailurePolicy(BackupFailurePolicy.FAIL)
      .strategy(BackupConfiguration.BackupStrategy.SYNC)
      .takeOffline()
         .afterFailures(500)
         .minTimeToWait(10000);

----

==== Taking a site back online
In order to bring a site back online after being taken offline, one can use the JMX console and invoke the "bringSiteOnline(siteName)" operation on the _XSiteAdmin_ managed bean. At the moment this method would need to be invoked on all the nodes within the site(further releases will overcome this limitation).

=== State Transfer between sites

NOTE: This feature is available since Infinispan *7.0.0.Alpha2*

When a new site is bough back online, it is necessary to re-sync the site with the most recent updates. This feature
allows state to be transferred from one site to another.

The state transfer is triggered manually by a system administrator (or other responsible entity) via JMX. The operation
can be found over the +XSiteAdminOperations+ managed bean and it is named +pushState(String)+. The system
administrator should invoke this operation in the provider site (i.e. the site that will send the state) and
set the name of the consumer site (i.e. the site that will receive the state). The figure below shows where to find
the +pushState(String)+ operation using JConsole:

image::images/xsite-state-transfer.png["JConsole pushState operation",height=495,width=720]

NOTE: The +pushState(siteName)+ operation will automatically bring the new site online. The system administrator does
not need to bring the site online first.

NOTE: The receiver site can only receive state from a single site.

The consumer site can be in any state (online or offline) in respect to the provider site and the system administrator
can trigger the push state at any time. The system will ignore multiple invocations if the provider site is already
pushing state to the consumer site.

It is worth to refer that it is not necessary to consumer site to be in an empty state. But be aware, the existing keys
can be overwritten but they are never deleted. In other words, if a key +K+ does not exists in the provider site but it
exists in consumer site, it will not be deleted. In other way, if a key +K+ exists in both sites, it will be overwritten
in the consumer site.

==== Handling join/leave nodes

The current implementation automatically handles the topology changes in producer or consumer site. Also, the cross-site
state transfer can run in parallel with a local site state transfer.

==== Handling broken link between sites

A System Administrator action is needed if the link between the producer and consumer site is broken during the
cross-site state transfer (data consistency is not ensured in consumer site). The producer site retries for a while
before giving up. Then, it gets back to normal state. However, the consumer site is not able to get back to normal state
and, here, an action from System Administrator is need. The System Administrator should use the operation
+cancelReceiveState(String siteName)+ to bring the consumer site to normal state.

==== System Administrator Operations

A set of operations can be performed to control the cross-site state transfer:

* +pushState(String siteName)+ - It starts the cross-site state transfer to the site name specified;

* +cancelPushState(String siteName)+ - It cancels the cross-site state transfer to the site name specified;

* +getRunningStateTransfer()+ - It returns a list of site name to which this site is pushing the state;

* +getSendingSiteName()+ - It returns the site name that is pushing state to this site;

* +cancelReceiveState(String siteName)+ - It restores the site to normal state. Should be used when the link between
the sites is broken during the state transfer (as described above);

* +getPushStateStatus()+ - It returns the status of completed cross-site state transfer;

* +clearPushStateStatus()+ - It clears the status of completed cross-site state transfer.

For more technical information, you can check the Cross Site design document (See <<x-site-reference, Reference>>).

[[x-site-st-configuration]]
==== Configuration
State transfer between sites cannot be enabled or disabled but it allows to tune some parameters. The values shown
below are the default values:

.infinispan.xml
[source,xml]
----

<replicated-cache name="xSiteStateTransfer">
   ...
   <backups>
      <backup site="NYC" strategy="SYNC" failure-policy="FAIL">
         <state-transfer chunk-size="512" timeout="1200000" max-retries="30" wait-time="2000" />
      </backup>
   </backups>
    ...
</replicated-cache>

----

The equivalent programmatic configuration is:

[source,java]
----

lon.sites().addBackup()
      .site("NYC")
      .backupFailurePolicy(BackupFailurePolicy.FAIL)
      .strategy(BackupConfiguration.BackupStrategy.SYNC)
      .stateTransfer()
         .chunkSize(512)
         .timeout(1200000)
         .maxRetries(30)
         .waitingTimeBetweenRetries(2000);

----

Below, it is the parameters description:

* _chunk-size_ - The number of keys to batch before sending them to the consumer site. A negative or a zero value is
*not* a valid value. Default value is 512 keys.

* _timeout_ - The time (in milliseconds) to wait for the consumer site acknowledge the reception and appliance of a
state chunk. A negative or zero value is *not* a valid value. Default value is 20 minutes.

* _max-retries_ - The maximum number of retries when a push state command fails. A negative or a zero value means that
the command will not retry in case of failure. Default value is 30.

* _wait-time_ - The waiting time (in milliseconds) between each retry. A negative or a zero value is *not* a valid
value. Default value is 2 seconds.
