===  REST Server

The {brandname} Server distribution contains a module that implements link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer[RESTful] HTTP access to the {brandname} data grid, built on https://github.com/netty/netty[Netty].

==== Running the REST server

The REST server endpoint is part of the {brandname} Server and by default listens on port 8080. To run the server locally,
link:http://infinispan.org/download/[download] the zip distribution and execute in the extracted directory:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

or alternatively, run via docker:

[source]
----
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e "APP_USER=user" -e "APP_PASS=changeme" jboss/infinispan-server
----

===== Security

The REST server is protected by authentication, so before usage it is necessary to create an application login.
When running via docker, this is achieved by the APP_USER and APP_PASS command line arguments, but when running
locally, this can be done with:


[source]
----
bin/add-user.sh -u user -p changeme -a
----


==== Supported protocols

The REST Server supports HTTP/1.1 as well as HTTP/2 protocols. It is possible to switch to HTTP/2 by either performing a https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#discover-http[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade procedure] or
by negotiating communication protocol using https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#versioning[TLS/ALPN extension].

Note: TLS/ALPN with JDK8 requires additional steps from the client perspective. Please refer to your client documentation but it is very likely
that you will need Jetty ALPN Agent or OpenSSL bindings.

==== REST API
HTTP PUT and POST methods are used to place data in the cache, with URLs to address the cache name and key(s) - the data being the body of the request (the data can be anything you like). Other headers are used to control the cache settings and behaviour.

===== Data formats

====== Configuration

Each cache exposed via REST stores data in a configurable data format defined by a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[MediaType].

An example of storage configuration is as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<cache>
   <encoding>
      <key media-type="application/x-java-object; type=java.lang.Integer"/>
      <value media-type="application/xml; charset=UTF-8"/>
   </encoding>
</cache>
----

When no MediaType is configured, {brandname} assumes "application/octet-stream" for both keys and values, with the following exceptions:

* If the cache is indexed, it assumes "application/x-protostream"
* If the cache is configured with compatibility mode, it assumes "application/x-java-object"

====== Supported formats

Data can be written and read in different formats than the storage format; {brandname} can convert between those formats when required.

The following "standard" formats can be converted interchangeably:

* _application/x-java-object_
* _application/octet-stream_
* _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_
* _text/plain_

The following formats can be converted to/from the formats above:

* __application/xml__
* _application/json_
* _application/x-jboss-marshalling_
* _application/x-protostream_
* _application/x-java-serialized_

Finally, the following conversion is also supported:

* Between _application/x-protostream_ and _application/json_

All the REST API calls can provide headers describing the content written or the required format of the content
when reading. {brandname} supports the standard HTTP/1.1 headers "Content-Type" and "Accept" that are applied for values,
plus the "Key-Content-Type" with similar effect for keys.


====== Accept header [[rest.accept]]

The REST server is compliant with the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html[RFC-2616] Accept header,
and will negotiate the correct MediaType based on the conversions supported. Example, sending the following header when reading data:

   Accept: text/plain;q=0.7, application/json;q=0.8, */*;q=0.6

will cause {brandname} to try first to return content in JSON format (higher priority 0.8). If it's not possible to convert the storage format
to JSON, next format tried will be _text/plain_ (second highest priority 0.7), and finally it falls back to _*/*_, that will pick a format
suitable for displaying automatically based on the cache configuration.

====== Key-Content-Type header [[rest.key_content_type]]

Most REST API calls have the Key included in the URL. {brandname} will assume the Key is a _java.lang.String_ when handling those calls, but
it's possible to use a specific header _Key-Content-Type_ for keys in different formats.

Examples:

* Specifying a byte[] Key as a Base64 string:

API call:

   PUT /my-cache/AQIDBDM=

Headers:

   Key-Content-Type: application/octet-stream

* Specifying a byte[] Key as a hexadecimal string:

API call:

   GET /my-cache/0x01CA03042F

Headers:

   Key-Content-Type: application/octet-stream; encoding=hex


* Specifying a double Key:

API call:

   POST /my-cache/3.141456

Headers:

   Key-Content-Type: application/x-java-object;type=java.lang.Double


The _type_ parameter for _application/x-java-object_ is restricted to:

* Primitive wrapper types
* java.lang.String
* Bytes, making _application/x-java-object;type=Bytes_ equivalent to _application/octet-stream;encoding=hex_


===== Putting data in

====== `PUT /{cacheName}/{cacheKey}`
A PUT request of the above URL form will place the payload (body) in the given cache, with the given key (the named cache must exist on the server). For example `http://someserver/hr/payRoll-3` (in which case `hr` is the cache name, and `payRoll-3` is the key). Any existing data will be replaced, and Time-To-Live and Last-Modified values etc will updated (if applicable).

====== `POST /{cacheName}/{cacheKey}`
Exactly the same as PUT, only if a value in a cache/key already exists, it will return a Http CONFLICT status (and the content will not be updated).

.Headers

*  <<rest.key_content_type,Key-Content-Type>> : OPTIONAL The content type for the Key present in the URL.

*  Content-Type : OPTIONAL The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[MediaType] of the Value being sent.

*  performAsync : OPTIONAL true/false (if true, this will return immediately, and then replicate data to the cluster on its own. Can help with bulk data inserts/large clusters.)

*  timeToLiveSeconds : OPTIONAL number (the number of seconds before this entry will automatically be deleted). If no parameter is sent, {brandname} assumes configuration default value. Passing any negative value will create an entry which will live forever.

*  maxIdleTimeSeconds : OPTIONAL number (the number of seconds after last usage of this entry when it will automatically be deleted). If no  parameter is sent, {brandname} configuration default value. Passing any negative value will create an entry which will live forever.

.Passing 0 as parameter for timeToLiveSeconds and/or maxIdleTimeSeconds
*  If both `timeToLiveSeconds` and `maxIdleTimeSeconds` are 0, the cache will use the default `lifespan` and `maxIdle` values configured in XML/programmatically
*  If _only_ `maxIdleTimeSeconds` is 0, it uses the `timeToLiveSeconds` value passed as parameter (or -1 if not present), and default `maxIdle` configured in XML/programmatically
*  If _only_ `timeToLiveSeconds` is 0, it uses default `lifespan` configured in XML/programmatically, and `maxIdle` is set to whatever came as parameter (or -1 if not present)

.JSON/Protostream conversion

When caches are indexed, or specifically configured to store _application/x-protostream_, it's possible to send and receive
JSON documents that are automatically converted to/from protostream. In order for the conversion to work, a protobuf schema must be registered.

The registration can be done via REST, by doing a POST/PUT in the ____protobuf_metadata_ cache. Example using cURL:

[source,bash]
----
curl -u user:password -X POST --data-binary @./schema.proto http://127.0.0.1:8080/rest/___protobuf_metadata/schema.proto
----

When writing a JSON document, a special field *__type_* must be present in the document to identity the protobuf _Message_
corresponding to the document.

For example, consider the following schema:

[source,protobuf]
----
message Person  {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 age = 2;
}
----

A conformant JSON document would be:


[source,json]
----
{
   "_type": "Person",
   "name": "user1",
   "age": 32
}
----


===== Getting data back out
HTTP GET and HEAD are used to retrieve data from entries.

====== `GET /{cacheName}/{cacheKey}`
This will return the data found in the given cacheName, under the given key - as the body of the response. A Content-Type header will be present in the response according to the Media Type negotiation. Browsers can use the cache directly of course (eg as a CDN). An link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag[ETag] will be returned unique for each entry, as will the Last-Modified and Expires headers field indicating the state of the data at the given URL. ETags allow browsers (and other clients) to ask for data only in the case where it has changed (to save on bandwidth) - this is standard HTTP and is honoured by {brandname}.

.Headers

*  <<rest.key_content_type,Key-Content-Type>> : OPTIONAL The content type for the Key present in the URL. When omitted, _application/x-java-object; type=java.lang.String_ is assumed
*  <<rest.accept,Accept>>: OPTIONAL The required format to return the content

Since {brandname} 5.3 it is possible to obtain additional information by appending the "extended" parameter on the query string, as follows:

 GET /cacheName/cacheKey?extended

This will return the following custom headers:


* Cluster-Primary-Owner: the node name of the primary owner for this key
* Cluster-Node-Name: the JGroups node name of the server that has handled the request
* Cluster-Physical-Address: the physical JGroups address of the server that has handled the request.

====== `HEAD /{cacheName}/{cacheKey}`
The same as GET, only no content is returned (only the header fields). You will receive the same content that you stored. E.g., if you stored a String, this is what you get back. If you stored some XML or JSON, this is what you will receive. If you stored a binary (base 64 encoded) blob, perhaps a serialized; Java; object - you will need to; deserialize this yourself.

Similarly to the GET method, the HEAD method also supports returning extended information via headers. See above.

.Headers

*  <<rest.key_content_type,Key-Content-Type>> : OPTIONAL The content type for the Key present in the URL. When omitted, _application/x-java-object; type=java.lang.String_ is assumed

===== Listing keys
====== `GET /{cacheName}`

This will return a list of keys present in the given cacheName as the body of the response. The format of the response can be controlled via the Accept header as follows:

* _application/xml_ - the list of keys will be returned in XML format.
* _application/json_ - the list of keys will be return in JSON format.
* _text/plain_ - the list of keys will be returned in plain text format, one key per line

If the cache identified by cacheName is distributed, only the keys owned by the node handling the request will be returned. To return all keys, append the "global" parameter to the query, as follows:

 GET /cacheName?global

===== Removing data
Data can be removed at the cache key/element level, or via a whole cache name using the HTTP delete method.

====== `DELETE /{cacheName}/{cacheKey}`

Removes the given key name from the cache.


.Headers

*  <<rest.key_content_type,Key-Content-Type>> : OPTIONAL The content type for the Key present in the URL. When omitted, _application/x-java-object; type=java.lang.String_ is assumed

====== `DELETE /{cacheName}`
Removes ALL the entries in the given cache name (i.e., everything from that path down). If the operation is successful, it returns 200 code.

.Make it quicker!
TIP: Set the header performAsync to true to return immediately and let the removal happen in the background.


===== Querying

The REST server supports Ickle Queries in JSON format. It's important that the cache is configured with
_application/x-protostream_ for both Keys and Values. If the cache is indexed, no configuration is needed.

====== `GET /{cacheName}?action=search&query={ickle query}`

Will execute an Ickle query in the given cache name.

.Request parameters

* _query_: REQUIRED the query string
* _max_results_: OPTIONAL the number of results to return, default is _10_
* _offset_: OPTIONAL the index of the first result to return, default is _0_
* _query_mode_: OPTIONAL the <<query.clustered-query-api,execution mode>> of the query once it's received by server. Valid values are _FETCH_ and _BROADCAST_. Default is _FETCH_.

.Query Result

Results are JSON documents containing one or more hits. Example:

[source, json]
----
{
  "total_results" : 150,
  "hits" : [ {
    "hit" : {
      "name" : "user1",
      "age" : 35
    }
  }, {
    "hit" : {
       "name" : "user2",
       "age" : 42
    }
  }, {
    "hit" : {
       "name" : "user3",
       "age" : 12
    }
  } ]
}
----

* _total_results_: NUMBER, the total number of results from the query.
* _hits_: ARRAY, list of matches from the query
* _hit_: OBJECT, each result from the query. Can contain all fields or just a subset of fields in case a _Select_ clause is used.


====== `POST /{cacheName}?action=search`

Similar to que query using GET, but the body of the request is used instead to specify the query parameters.

Example:

[source,json]
----
{
 "query":"from Entity where name:\"user1\"",
 "max_results":20,
 "offset":10
}
----

==== CORS

The REST server supports https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[CORS] including preflight and rules based on the request origin.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<rest-connector name="rest1" socket-binding="rest" cache-container="default">
   <cors-rules>
      <cors-rule name="restrict host1" allow-credentials="false">
         <allowed-origins>http://host1,https://host1</allowed-origins>
         <allowed-methods>GET</allowed-methods>
      </cors-rule>
      <cors-rule name="allow ALL" allow-credentials="true" max-age-seconds="2000">
         <allowed-origins>*</allowed-origins>
         <allowed-methods>GET,OPTIONS,POST,PUT,DELETE</allowed-methods>
         <allowed-headers>Key-Content-Type</allowed-headers>
      </cors-rule>
   </cors-rules>
</rest-connector>
----

The rules are evaluated sequentially based on the "Origin" header set by the browser; in the example above if the origin is either "http://host1" or "https://host1" the rule "restrict host1" will apply,
otherwise the next rule will be tested. Since the rule "allow ALL" permits all origins, any script coming from a different origin will be able to perform the methods specified and use the headers supplied.

The <cors-rule> element can be configured as follows:



|===
| Config   | Description  | Mandatory 

| name  | The name of the rule | yes 
| allow-credentials | Enable CORS requests to use credentials | no   
| allowed-origins | A comma separated list used to set the CORS 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header to indicate the response can be shared with the origins | yes 
| allowed-methods | A comma separated list used to set the CORS 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' header in the preflight response to specify the methods allowed for the configured origin(s) | yes 
| max-age-seconds | The amount of time CORS preflight request headers can be cached | no 
| expose-headers | A comma separated list used to set the CORS 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' in the preflight response to specify which headers can be exposed to the configured origin(s) | no 
|===


==== Client side code
Part of the point of a RESTful service is that you don't need to have tightly coupled client libraries/bindings. All you need is a HTTP client library. For Java, Apache HTTP Commons Client works just fine (and is used in the integration tests), or you can use java.net API.
