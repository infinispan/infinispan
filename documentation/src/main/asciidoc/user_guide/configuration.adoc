==  Configuration

Infinispan offers both declarative and programmatic configuration.

Declarative configuration comes in a form of XML document that adheres to a provided Infinispan configuration XML link:http://www.infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-{infinispanversion}.xsd[schema].

Every aspect of Infinispan that can be configured declaratively can also be configured programmatically
In fact, declarative configuration, behind the scenes, invokes programmatic configuration API as the XML configuration file is being processed.
One can even use a combination of these approaches.
For example, you can read static XML configuration files and at runtime programmatically tune that same configuration.
Or you can use a certain static configuration defined in XML as a starting point or template for defining additional configurations in runtime.

There are two main configuration abstractions in Infinispan: `global` and `cache`.

.Global configuration
Global configuration defines global settings shared among all cache instances created by a single link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html[EmbeddedCacheManager].
Shared resources like thread pools, serialization/marshalling settings, transport and network settings, JMX domains are all part of global configuration.

.Cache configuration
Cache configuration is specific to the actual caching domain itself: it specifies eviction, locking, transaction, clustering, persistence etc.
You can specify as many named cache configurations as you need. One of these caches can be indicated as the `default` cache,
which is the cache returned by the `CacheManager.getCache()` API, whereas other named caches are retrieved via the `CacheManager.getCache(String name)` API.

Whenever they are specified, named caches inherit settings from the default cache while additional behavior can be specified or overridden.
Infinispan also provides a very flexible inheritance mechanism, where you can define a hierarchy of configuration templates,
allowing multiple caches to share the same settings, or overriding specific parameters as necessary.

NOTE: Embedded and Server configuration use different schemas, but we strive to maintain them as compatible as possible so that you
can easily migrate between the two.

===  Configuring caches declaratively
One of the major goals of Infinispan is to aim for zero configuration.
A simple XML configuration file containing nothing more than a single infinispan element is enough to get you started.
The configuration file listed below provides sensible defaults and is perfectly valid.

[source,xml]
.infinispan.xml
----

<infinispan />

----

However, that would only give you the most basic, local mode, non-clustered cache manager with no caches.
Non-basic configurations are very likely to use customized global and default cache elements.

Declarative configuration is the most common approach to configuring Infinispan cache instances.
In order to read XML configuration files one would typically construct an instance of DefaultCacheManager by pointing to an XML file containing Infinispan configuration.
Once the configuration file is read you can obtain reference to the default cache instance.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/configuration/ConfigurationUnitTest.java[tags=basic-example]
----

or any other named instance specified in `configs/my-custom-config.xml`.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/configuration/ConfigurationUnitTest.java[tags=named-cache-retrieval]
----

The name of the default cache is defined in the `<cache-container>` element of the XML configuration file, and additional
caches can be configured using the `<local-cache>`,`<distributed-cache>`,`<invalidation-cache>` or `<replicated-cache>` elements.

The following example shows the simplest possible configuration for each of the cache types supported by Infinispan:

[source,xml]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/resources/configs/my-custom-config.xml[tags=example]
----

==== Cache configuration templates

As mentioned above, Infinispan supports the notion of _configuration templates_. These are full or partial configuration
declarations which can be shared among multiple caches or as the basis for more complex configurations.

The following example shows how a configuration named `local-template` is used to define a cache named `local`.

[source,xml]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/resources/configs/my-custom-config2.xml[tags=example]
----

Templates can inherit from previously defined templates, augmenting and/or overriding some or all of the configuration elements:

[source,xml]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/resources/configs/my-custom-config3.xml[tags=example]
----

In the above example, `base-template` defines a local cache with a specific _expiration_ configuration. The `extended-template`
configuration inherits from `base-template`, overriding just a single parameter of the _expiration_ element (all other
attributes are inherited) and adds a _memory_ element. Finally, two caches are defined: `local` which uses the `base-template`
configuration and `local-bounded` which uses the `extended-template` configuration.

WARNING: Be aware that for multi-valued elements (such as `properties`) the inheritance is additive, i.e. the child configuration will be the result of merging the properties from the parent and its own.

==== Declarative configuration reference

For more details on the declarative configuration schema, refer to the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/configdocs[configuration reference].
If you are using XML editing tools for configuration writing you can use the provided Infinispan link:http://infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-config-{infinispanversion}.xsd[schema] to assist you.

===  Configuring caches programmatically
Programmatic Infinispan configuration is centered around the CacheManager and ConfigurationBuilder API.
Although every single aspect of Infinispan configuration could be set programmatically, the most usual approach is to create a starting point in a form of XML configuration file and then in runtime, if needed, programmatically tune a specific configuration to suit the use case best.

[source,java]
----
include::{rootDir}/core/src/test/java/org/infinispan/configuration/ConfigurationUnitTest.java[tags=basic-example]
----

Let's assume that a new synchronously replicated cache is to be configured programmatically.
First, a fresh instance of Configuration object is created using ConfigurationBuilder helper object, and the cache mode is set to synchronous replication.
Finally, the configuration is defined/registered with a manager.

[source,java]
----
Configuration c = new ConfigurationBuilder().clustering().cacheMode(CacheMode.REPL_SYNC).build();

String newCacheName = "repl";
manager.defineConfiguration(newCacheName, c);
Cache<String, String> cache = manager.getCache(newCacheName);

----

The default cache configuration (or any other cache configuration) can be used as a starting point for creation of a new cache.
For example, lets say that `infinispan-config-file.xml` specifies a replicated cache as a default and that a distributed cache is desired with a specific L1 lifespan while at the same time retaining all other aspects of a default cache.
Therefore, the starting point would be to read an instance of a default Configuration object and use `ConfigurationBuilder` to construct and modify cache mode and L1 lifespan on a new `Configuration` object. As a final step the configuration is defined/registered with a manager.

[source,java]
----
EmbeddedCacheManager manager = new DefaultCacheManager("infinispan-config-file.xml");
Configuration dcc = manager.getDefaultCacheConfiguration();
Configuration c = new ConfigurationBuilder().read(dcc).clustering().cacheMode(CacheMode.DIST_SYNC).l1().lifespan(60000L).build();
 
String newCacheName = "distributedWithL1";
manager.defineConfiguration(newCacheName, c);
Cache<String, String> cache = manager.getCache(newCacheName);

----

As long as the base configuration is the default named cache, the previous code works perfectly fine. However, other times the base configuration might be another named cache. So, how can new configurations be defined based on other defined caches? Take the previous example and imagine that instead of taking the default cache as base, a named cache called "replicatedCache" is used as base. The code would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
EmbeddedCacheManager manager = new DefaultCacheManager("infinispan-config-file.xml");
Configuration rc = manager.getCacheConfiguration("replicatedCache");
Configuration c = new ConfigurationBuilder().read(rc).clustering().cacheMode(CacheMode.DIST_SYNC).l1().lifespan(60000L).build();
 
String newCacheName = "distributedWithL1";
manager.defineConfiguration(newCacheName, c);
Cache<String, String> cache = manager.getCache(newCacheName);

----

Refer to link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/CacheManager.html[CacheManager] , link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/ConfigurationBuilder.html[ConfigurationBuilder] , link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/Configuration.html[Configuration] , and link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/configuration/global/GlobalConfiguration.html[GlobalConfiguration] javadocs for more details.

==== ConfigurationBuilder Programmatic Configuration API
While the above paragraph shows how to combine declarative and programmatic configuration, starting from an XML configuration is completely optional.
The ConfigurationBuilder fluent interface style allows for easier to write and more readable programmatic configuration.
This approach can be used for both the global and the cache level configuration.
GlobalConfiguration objects are constructed using GlobalConfigurationBuilder while Configuration objects are built using ConfigurationBuilder.
Let's look at some examples on configuring both global and cache level options with this API:

One of the most commonly configured global option is the transport layer, where you indicate how an Infinispan node will discover the others:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration globalConfig = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder().transport()
        .defaultTransport()
        .clusterName("qa-cluster")
        .addProperty("configurationFile", "jgroups-tcp.xml")
        .machineId("qa-machine").rackId("qa-rack")
      .build();

----

Sometimes you might also want to enable collection of link:{javadocroot}/jmxComponents.html[global JMX statistics]
at cache manager level or get information about the transport. To enable global JMX statistics simply do:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration globalConfig = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder()
  .globalJmxStatistics()
  .enable()
  .build();

----

Please note that by not enabling (or by explicitly disabling) global JMX statistics your are just turning off statistics
collection. The corresponding MBean is still registered and can be used to manage the cache manager in general, but the
statistics attributes do not return meaningful values.

Further options at the global JMX statistics level allows you to configure the cache manager name which comes handy when you have multiple cache managers running on the same system, or how to locate the JMX MBean Server:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration globalConfig = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder()
  .globalJmxStatistics()
    .cacheManagerName("SalesCacheManager")
    .mBeanServerLookup(new JBossMBeanServerLookup())
  .build();

----

Some of the Infinispan features are powered by a group of the thread pool executors which can also be tweaked at this global level. For example:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration globalConfig = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder()
   .replicationQueueThreadPool()
     .threadPoolFactory(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorFactory.create())
  .build();

----

You can not only configure global, cache manager level, options, but you can also configure cache level options such as the <<_cluster_mode, cluster mode>>:

[source,java]
----
Configuration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
  .clustering()
    .cacheMode(CacheMode.DIST_SYNC)
    .sync()
    .l1().lifespan(25000L)
    .hash().numOwners(3)
  .build();

----

Or you can configure <<_eviction, eviction and expiration settings>>:

[source,java]
----
Configuration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
           .memory()
             .size(20000)
          .expiration()
             .wakeUpInterval(5000L)
             .maxIdle(120000L)
           .build();

----

An application might also want to interact with an Infinispan cache within the boundaries of JTA and to do that you need to configure the transaction layer and optionally tweak the locking settings. When interacting with transactional caches, you might want to enable recovery to deal with transactions that finished with an heuristic outcome and if you do that, you will often want to enable JMX management and statistics gathering too:

[source,java]
----
Configuration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
  .locking()
    .concurrencyLevel(10000).isolationLevel(IsolationLevel.REPEATABLE_READ)
    .lockAcquisitionTimeout(12000L).useLockStriping(false).writeSkewCheck(true)
    .versioning().enable().scheme(VersioningScheme.SIMPLE)
  .transaction()
    .transactionManagerLookup(new GenericTransactionManagerLookup())
    .recovery()
  .jmxStatistics()
  .build();

----

Configuring Infinispan with chained cache stores is simple too:

[source,java]
----
Configuration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
   .persistence().passivation(false)
   .addSingleFileStore().location("/tmp").async().enable()
   .preload(false).shared(false).threadPoolSize(20).build();
----

==== Advanced programmatic configuration

The fluent configuration can also be used to configure more advanced or exotic options, such as advanced externalizers:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration globalConfig = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder()
  .serialization()
    .addAdvancedExternalizer(998, new PersonExternalizer())
    .addAdvancedExternalizer(999, new AddressExternalizer())
  .build();

----

Or, add custom interceptors:

[source,java]
----
Configuration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
  .customInterceptors().addInterceptor()
    .interceptor(new FirstInterceptor()).position(InterceptorConfiguration.Position.FIRST)
    .interceptor(new LastInterceptor()).position(InterceptorConfiguration.Position.LAST)
    .interceptor(new FixPositionInterceptor()).index(8)
    .interceptor(new AfterInterceptor()).after(NonTransactionalLockingInterceptor.class)
    .interceptor(new BeforeInterceptor()).before(CallInterceptor.class)
  .build();

----

For information on the individual configuration options, please check the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/configdocs/[configuration guide] .

===  Configuration Migration Tools
The configuration format of Infinispan has changed since version 6.0 in order to align the embedded schema with the one used
by the server. For this reason, when upgrading to Infinispan 7.x or later, you should use the configuration converter included in the
_all_ distribution. Simply invoke it from the command-line passing the old configuration file as the first parameter and the name
of the converted file as the second parameter.

To convert on Unix/Linux/macOS:

[source,shell]
----

bin/config-converter.sh oldconfig.xml newconfig.xml

----

on Windows:

[source,shell]
----

bin\config-converter.bat oldconfig.xml newconfig.xml

----

TIP: If you wish to help write conversion tools from other caching systems, please contact link:https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/infinispan-dev[infinispan-dev].

===  Clustered Configuration
Infinispan uses link:http://www.jgroups.org[JGroups] for network communications when in clustered mode.
Infinispan ships with _pre-configured_ JGroups stacks that make it easy for you to jump-start a clustered configuration.

==== Using an external JGroups file
If you are configuring your cache programmatically, all you need to do is:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration gc = new GlobalConfigurationBuilder()
   .transport().defaultTransport()
   .addProperty("configurationFile", "jgroups.xml")
   .build();

----

and if you happen to use an XML file to configure Infinispan, just use:

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan>
  <jgroups>
     <stack-file name="external-file" path="jgroups.xml"/>
  </jgroups>
  <cache-container default-cache="replicatedCache">
    <transport stack="external-file" />
    <replicated-cache name="replicatedCache"/>
  </cache-container>

  ...

</infinispan>

----

In both cases above, Infinispan looks for _jgroups.xml_ first in your classpath, and then for an absolute path name if not found in the classpath.

==== Use one of the pre-configured JGroups files
Infinispan ships with a few different JGroups files (packaged in infinispan-core.jar) which means they will already be on your classpath by default.
All you need to do is specify the file name, e.g., instead of `jgroups.xml` above, specify `/default-configs/default-jgroups-tcp.xml`.

The configurations available are:

*  default-jgroups-udp.xml - Uses UDP as a transport, and UDP multicast for discovery.  Usually suitable for larger (over 100 nodes) clusters _or_ if you are using link:#replicated_mode[replication] or link:#invalidation_mode[invalidation]. Minimises opening too many sockets.
*  default-jgroups-tcp.xml - Uses TCP as a transport and UDP multicast for discovery.  Better for smaller clusters (under 100 nodes) _only if_ you are using link:#distribution_mode[distribution], as TCP is more efficient as a point-to-point protocol
*  default-jgroups-ec2.xml - Uses TCP as a transport and link:http://jgroups.org/manual/index.html#_s3_ping[S3_PING] for discovery.  Suitable on link:http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] nodes where UDP multicast isn't available.
*  default-jgroups-kubernetes.xml - Uses TCP as a transport and link:https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes[KUBE_PING] for discovery.  Suitable on link:http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] and link:https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift] nodes where UDP multicast is not always available.

===== Tuning JGroups settings
The settings above can be further tuned without editing the XML files themselves.
Passing in certain system properties to your JVM at startup can affect the behaviour of some of these settings.  The table below shows you which settings can be configured in this way.  E.g.,

----
$ java -cp ... -Djgroups.tcp.port=1234 -Djgroups.tcp.address=10.11.12.13
----

==== Further reading
JGroups also supports more system property overrides, details of which can be found on this page: link:http://www.jgroups.org/manual4/index.html#SystemProperties[SystemProps]

In addition, the JGroups configuration files shipped with Infinispan are intended as a jumping off point to getting something up and running, and working.  More often than not though, you will want to fine-tune your JGroups stack further to extract every ounce of performance from your network equipment.  For this, your next stop should be the JGroups manual which has a link:http://jgroups.org/manual/html/protlist.html[detailed section] on configuring each of the protocols you see in a JGroups configuration file.
