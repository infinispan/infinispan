==== Hot Rod Protocol
The following articles provides detailed information about each version of
the custom TCP client/server Hot Rod protocol.

* link:$$#_hot_rod_protocol_1_0$$[Hot Rod Protocol 1.0]
* link:$$#_hot_rod_protocol_1_1$$[Hot Rod Protocol 1.1]

===== Hot Rod Protocol 1.0

.Infinispan versions
TIP: This version of the protocol is implemented since Infinispan 4.1.0.Final

IMPORTANT: All key and values are sent and stored as byte arrays. Hot Rod
makes no assumptions about their types.

Some clarifications about the other types:

* vInt : Variable-length integers are defined defined as compressed,
positive integers  where the high-order bit of each byte indicates whether
more bytes need to be  read. The low-order seven bits are appended as
increasingly more significant bits in the resulting integer value making it
efficient to decode. Hence, values from zero to 127 are  stored in a single
byte, values from 128 to 16,383 are stored in two bytes, and so on:

* vLong : Refers to unsigned variable length long values similar to vInt but
applied to longer values. They're between 1 and 9 bytes long.
* String : Strings are always represented using UTF-8 encoding.

====== Request Header

The header for a request is composed of:

.Request header

[cols="3,^2,10",options="header"]
|==============================================================================
|Field Name           | Size       | Value

| Magic               | 1 byte     | +0xA0+ = request
| Message ID          | vLong      | ID of the message that will be copied
back in the response. This allows for hot rod clients to implement the
protocol in an asynchronous way.
| Version             | 1 byte     | Infinispan hot rod server version.
In this particular case, this is +10+
| Opcode              | 1 byte     | Request operation code: +
+0x01+ = put request +
+0x03+ = get +
+0x05+ = putIfAbsent +
+0x07+ = replace +
+0x09+ = replaceIfUnmodified +
+0x0B+ = remove +
+0x0D+ = removeIfUnmodified +
+0x0F+ = containsKey +
+0x11+ = getWithVersion +
+0x13+ = clear +
+0x15+ = stats +
+0x17+ = ping +
+0x19+ = bulkGet +
| Cache Name Length   | vInt       | Length of cache name. If the passed
length is +0+ (followed by no cache name), the operation will interact with
the default cache.
| Cache Name          | string     | Name of cache on which to operate.
This name must match the name of predefined cache in the Infinispan
configuration file.
| Flags               | vInt       |  A variable length number representing
flags passed to the system. Each flags is represented by a bit. Note that
since this field is sent as variable length, the most significant bit in a
byte is used to determine whether more bytes need to be read, hence this bit
does not represent any flag. Using this model allows for flags to be combined
in a short space. Here are the current values for each flag: +
+0x0001+ = force return previous value
| Client Intelligence | 1 byte     |  This byte hints the server on the client capabilities: +
+0x01+ = basic client, interested in neither cluster nor hash information +
+0x02+ = topology-aware client, interested in cluster information +
+0x03+ = hash-distribution-aware client, that is interested in both cluster and hash information +
| Topology Id         | vInt       | This field represents the last known
view in the client. Basic clients will only send 0 in this field.
When topology-aware or hash-distribution-aware clients will send 0 until they
have received a reply from the server with the current view id.
Afterwards, they should send that view id until they receive a new view id
in a response.
| Transaction Type    | 1 byte     | This is a 1 byte field, containing one
of the following well-known supported transaction types (For this version of
the protocol, the only supported transaction type is 0): +
+0+ = Non-transactional call, or client does not support transactions.
The subsequent TX_ID field will be omitted. +
+1+ = X/Open XA transaction ID (XID). This is a well-known, fixed-size format.
| Transaction Id      | byte array |  The byte array uniquely identifying the
transaction associated to this call. It’s length is determined by the
transaction type. If transaction type is 0, no transaction id will be present.
|==============================================================================

====== Response Header

The header for a response is composed of:

.Response header

[cols="3,^2,10",options="header"]
|==============================================================================
|Field Name           | Size       | Value

| Magic                  | 1 byte     | +0xA1+ = response
| Message ID             | vLong      | ID of the message, matching the request
for which the response is sent.
| Opcode                 | 1 byte     | Response operation code: +
+0x02+ = put +
+0x04+ = get +
+0x06+ = putIfAbsent +
+0x08+ = replace +
+0x0A+ = replaceIfUnmodified +
+0x0C+ = remove +
+0x0E+ = removeIfUnmodified +
+0x10+ = containsKey +
+0x12+ = getWithVersion +
+0x14+ = clear +
+0x16+ = stats +
+0x18+ = ping +
+0x1A+ = bulkGet +
+0x50+ = error +
| Status                 | 1 byte     | Status of the response, possible values: +
+0x00+ = No error +
+0x01+ = Not put/removed/replaced +
+0x02+ = Key does not exist +
+0x81+ = Invalid magic or message id +
+0x82+ = Unknown command +
+0x83+ = Unknown version +
+0x84+ = Request parsing error +
+0x85+ = Server Error +
+0x86+ = Command timed out +
| Topology Change Marker | string     | This is a marker byte that indicates
whether the response is prepended with topology change information.
When no topology change follows, the content of this byte is +0+.
If a topology change follows, its contents are +1+.
|==============================================================================

CAUTION: Exceptional error status responses, those that start with 0x8 ...,
are followed by the length of the error message (as a vInt ) and
error message itself as String.

====== Topology Change Headers
The following section discusses how the response headers look for
topology-aware or hash-distribution-aware clients when there's been a cluster
or view formation change. Note that it's the server that makes the decision on
whether it sends back the new topology based on the current topology id and
the one the client sent. If they're different, it will send back the new topology.

====== Topology-Aware Client Topology Change Header
This is what topology-aware clients receive as response header when a
topology change is sent back:

This could be a subset of the entire cluster if only a fraction of those
nodes are running Hot Rod servers.

| ...etc||
|==============================================================================

It's important to note that since hash headers rely on the consistent hash
algorithm used by the server and this is a factor of the cache interacted with,
hash-distribution-aware headers can only be returned to operations that target
a particular cache. Currently ping command does not target any cache
(this is to change as per link:$$https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/ISPN-424$$[ISPN-424])
, hence calls to ping command with hash-topology-aware client settings will
return a hash-distribution-aware header with "Num Key Owners",
"Hash Function Version", "Hash space size" and each individual host's hash
code all set to 0. This type of header will also be returned as response to
operations with hash-topology-aware client settings that are targeting caches
that are not configured with distribution.

.Multi-Get Operations
A multi-get operation is a form of get operation that instead of requesting a
single key, requests a set of keys. The Hot Rod protocol does not include such
operation but remote Hot Rod clients could easily implement this type of
operations by either parallelizing/pipelining individual get requests.
Another possibility would be for remote clients to use async or non-blocking
get requests. For example, if a client wants N keys, it could send send N
async get requests and then wait for all the replies. Finally, multi-get is
not to be confused with bulk-get operations. In bulk-gets, either all or a
number of keys are retrieved, but the client does not know which keys to
retrieve, whereas in multi-get, the client defines which keys to retrieve.

===== Server node hash code calculation

Adding support for virtual nodes has made version +1.0+ of the Hot Rod protocol
impractical due to bandwidth it would have taken to return hash codes for all
virtual nodes in the clusters (this number could easily be in the millions).
So, as of version +1.1+ of the Hot Rod protocol, clients are given the base
hash id or hash code of each server, and then they have to calculate the real
hash position of each server both with and without virtual nodes configured.
Here are the rules clients should follow when trying to calculate a node's
hash code:

$$1.$$  With _virtual nodes disabled_ : Once clients have received the base
hash code of the server, they need to normalize it in order to find the exact
position of the hash wheel. The process of normalization involves passing the
base hash code to the hash function, and then do a small calculation to avoid
negative values. The resulting number is the node's position in the hash wheel:

[source,java]
----
public static int getNormalizedHash(int nodeBaseHashCode, Hash hashFct) {
   return hashFct.hash(nodeBaseHashCode) & Integer.MAX_VALUE; // make sure no negative numbers are involved.
}
----

$$2.$$  With _virtual nodes enabled_ : In this case, each node represents N
different virtual nodes, and to calculate each virtual node's hash code, we
need to take the the range of numbers between 0 and N-1 and apply the
following logic:

* For virtual node with 0 as id, use the technique used to retrieve a node's
hash code, as shown in the previous section.

* For virtual nodes from 1 to N-1 ids, execute the following logic:

[source,java]
----
public static int virtualNodeHashCode(int nodeBaseHashCode, int id, Hash hashFct) {
   int virtualNodeBaseHashCode = id;
   virtualNodeBaseHashCode = 31 * virtualNodeBaseHashCode + nodeBaseHashCode;
   return getNormalizedHash(virtualNodeBaseHashCode, hashFct);
}
----


===== Hot Rod Protocol 1.2

.Infinispan versions
TIP: This version of the protocol is implemented since Infinispan 5.2.0.Final. Since Infinispan 5.3.0, HotRod supports encryption via SSL. However, since this only affects the transport, the version number of the protocol has not been incremented.

local to the server receiving the request (that is because the keys should
be the same across all nodes in a replicated cache). +

As of Infinispan 6.0, the query and response objects are specified by the protobuf message types 'org.infinispan.client.hotrod.impl.query.QueryRequest' and 'org.infinispan.client.hotrod.impl.query.QueryResponse'
respectively defined in link:$$https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/remote-query/remote-query-client/src/main/resources/query.proto$$[remote-query/remote-query-client/src/main/resources/query.proto].
These definitions could change in future Infinispan versions, but as long as these evolutions will be kept backward
compatible (according to the rules defined link:$$https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#updating$$[here]) no new Hot Rod
protocol version will be introduced to accommodate this.

==== Hot Rod Hash Functions
Infinispan makes use of a consistent hash function to place nodes on a hash
wheel, and to place keys of entries on the same wheel to determine where
entries live.

In Infinispan 4.2 and earlier, the hash space was hardcoded to 10240, but
since 5.0, the hash space is
link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE$$[Integer.MAX_INT] .
Please note that since Hot Rod clients should not assume a particular hash
space by default, every time a hash-topology change is detected, this value is
sent back to the client via the Hot Rod protocol.

When interacting with Infinispan via the Hot Rod protocol, it is mandated
that keys (and values) are byte arrays, to ensure platform neutral behavior.
As such, smart-clients which are aware of hash distribution on the backend
would need to be able to calculate the hash codes of such byte array keys,
again in a platform-neutral manner. To this end, the hash functions used by
Infinispan are versioned and documented, so that it can be re-implemented by
non-Java clients if needed.

The version of the hash function in use is provided in the Hot Rod protocol,
as the hash function version parameter.

.  Version 1 (single byte, 0x01) The initial version of the hash function in
use is link:$$https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/commons/src/main/java/org/infinispan/commons/hash/MurmurHash2.java$$[Austin Appleby's MurmurHash 2.0 algorithm] , a fast, non-cryptographic hash that exhibits excellent distribution, collision resistance and avalanche behavior.  The specific version of the algorithm used is the slightly slower, endian-neutral version that allows consistent behavior across both big- and little-endian CPU architectures.  Infinispan's version also hard-codes the hash seed as -1. For details of the algorithm, please visit link:$$http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/$$[Austin Appleby's MurmurHash 2.0 page] .  Other implementations are detailed on link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash$$[Wikipedia] .
This hash function was the default one used by the Hot Rod server until Infinispan 4.2.1.

.  Version 2 (single byte, 0x02) Since Infinispan 5.0, a new hash function is
used by default which is
link:$$https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/commons/src/main/java/org/infinispan/commons/hash/MurmurHash3.java$$[Austin Appleby's MurmurHash 3.0 algorithm] . Detailed information about the hash function can be found in this link:$$http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3$$[wiki] .
Compared to 2.0, it provides better performance and spread.
