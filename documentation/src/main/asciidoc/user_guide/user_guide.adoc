Welcome to the official Infinispan user guide.
This comprehensive document will guide you through every last detail of Infinispan, 
however can be a poor starting point if you are new to Infinispan.

TIP: For newbies, starting with the link:../getting_started/getting_started.html[Getting Started Guide]
or one of the link:http://www.infinispan.org/documentation[Quickstarts] is probably a better bet.

The link:../faqs/faqs.html[Frequently Asked Questions] and link:../glossary/glossary.html[Glossary]
are also useful documents to have alongside this user guide.

// For some reason the chapter numbering got messed up when exporting from Confluence...
