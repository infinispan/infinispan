=== RocksDB Cache Store
The {brandname} Community

==== Introduction
link:http://rocksdb.org/[RocksDB] is a fast key-value filesystem-based storage from Facebook. It started as a fork of
Google's LevelDB, but provides superior performance and reliability, especially in highly concurrent scenarios.

==== Segmentation support
This store supports being segmented, as it will create a separate column family per
segment. This should improve lookup performance and iteration substantially. However
writes are a little slower in this mode.

Another thing to note is that you should not configure more than a few hundred segments.
RocksDB is not designed to have as many column families as you want. This will also
adversely affect startup time of the store and could take many seconds to minutes
if you have too many segments.

===== Sample Usage
The RocksDB cache store requires 2 filesystem directories to be configured - each directory contains a RocksDB database:
one location is used to store non-expired data, while the second location is used to store expired keys pending purge.

[source,java]
----
Configuration cacheConfig = new ConfigurationBuilder().persistence()
				.addStore(RocksDBStoreConfigurationBuilder.class)
				.build();
EmbeddedCacheManager cacheManager = new DefaultCacheManager(cacheConfig);

Cache<String, User> usersCache = cacheManager.getCache("usersCache");
usersCache.put("raytsang", new User(...));

----

==== Configuration

It is also possible to configure the underlying rocks db instance. This can be done
via properties in the store configuration. Any property that is prefixed with the
name `database` will configure the rocks db database. Data is now stored in column
families, these can be configured independently of the database by setting
a property prefixed with the name `data`.

Note that you do not have to supply properties and this is entirely optional.

===== Sample Programatic Configuration

[source,java]
----
Properties props = new Properties();
props.addProperty("database.max_background_compactions", "2");
props.addProperty("data.write_buffer_size", "512MB");

Configuration cacheConfig = new ConfigurationBuilder().persistence()
				.addStore(RocksDBStoreConfigurationBuilder.class)
				.location("/tmp/rocksdb/data")
				.expiredLocation("/tmp/rocksdb/expired")
        .properties(props)
				.build();

|Parameter|Description
|location|Directory to use for RocksDB to store primary cache store data.  The directory will be auto-created if it does not exit.
|expiredLocation| Directory to use for RocksDB to store expiring data pending to be purged permanently.  The directory will be auto-created if it does not exit.
| expiryQueueSize |Size of the in-memory queue to hold expiring entries before it gets flushed into expired RocksDB store
|clearThreshold| There are two methods to clear all entries in RocksDB.  One method is to iterate through all entries and remove each entry individually.  The other method is to delete the database and re-init.  For smaller databases, deleting individual entries is faster than the latter method.  This configuration sets the max number of entries allowed before using the latter method
