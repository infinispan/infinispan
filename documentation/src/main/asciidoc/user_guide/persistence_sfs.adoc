==== Single File Store

Starting with {brandname} 6.0, a new file cache store has been created called
single file cache store. The old pre-6.0 file cache store has been completely
removed, and it's no longer configurable.

NOTE: Check <<_Data_migration_section,Data Migration section>> for information
on how to migrate old file based cache store data to the new single file
cache store.

The new single file cache store keeps all data in a single file. The way it
looks up data is by keeping an in-memory index of keys and the positions of
their values in this file. This results in greater performance compared to old
file cache store. There is one caveat though. Since the single file based
cache store keeps keys in memory, it can lead to increased memory consumption,
and hence it's not recommended for caches with big keys.

In certain use cases, this cache store suffers from fragmentation: if you
store larger and larger values, the space is not reused and instead the entry
is appended at the end of the file. The space (now empty) is reused only if you
write another entry that can fit there. Also, when you remove all entries from
the cache, the file won't shrink, and neither will be de-fragmented.

These are the available configuration options for the single file cache store:

* `path` where data will be stored. (e.g., `path="/tmp/myDataStore"`).
By default, the location is `{brandname}-SingleFileStore`.

* `max-entries` specifies the maximum number of entries to keep in this file
store. As mentioned before, in order to speed up lookups, the single file
cache store keeps an index of keys and their corresponding position in the
file. To avoid this index resulting in memory consumption problems, this
cache store can bounded by a maximum number of entries that it stores. If
this limit is exceeded, entries are removed permanently using the LRU
algorithm both from  the in-memory index and the underlying file based
cache store. So, setting a maximum limit only makes sense when {brandname} is
used as a cache, whose contents can be recomputed or they can be retrieved
from the authoritative data store. If this maximum limit is set when the
{brandname} is used as an authoritative data store, it could lead to data
loss, and hence it's not recommended for this use case. The default value is
`-1` which means that the file store size is unlimited.
