==  Running on Cloud Services

In order to turn on Cloud support for Infinispan library mode, one needs to add a new dependency to the classpath:

.Cloud support in library mode
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
      <artifactId>infinispan-cloud</artifactId>
      <version>${infinispan.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The above dependency adds `infinispan-core` to the classpath as well as some default configurations.

=== Amazon Web Services
Infinispan can be used on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) platform and similar cloud based environment in several ways. As Infinispan uses JGroups as the underlying communication technology, the majority of the configuration work is done JGroups. The default auto discovery won't work on EC2 as multicast is not allowed, but JGroups provides several other discovery protocols so we only have to choose one.

==== TCPPing, GossipRouter, S3_PING
The TCPPing approach contains a static list of the IP address of each member of the cluster in the JGroups configuration file.
While this works it doesn't really help when cluster nodes are dynamically added to the cluster.

.Sample TCPPing configuration
[source,xml]
----
<config>
      <TCP bind_port="7800" />
      <TCPPING timeout="3000"
           initial_hosts="${jgroups.tcpping.initial_hosts:localhost[7800],localhost[7801]}"
           port_range="1"
           num_initial_members="3"/>
...
...
</config>
----

See link:http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JGroupsTCPPING[] for more information about TCPPing.

==== GossipRouter
Another approach is to have a central server (Gossip, which each node will be configured to contact. This central server will tell each node in the cluster about each other node.

The address (ip:port) that the Gossip router is listening on can be injected into the JGroups configuration used by Infinispan. To do this pass the gossip routers address as a system property to the JVM e.g. `-DGossipRouterAddress="10.10.2.4[12001]"` and reference this property in the JGroups configuration that Infinispan is using e.g.

.Sample TCPGOSSIP configuration
[source,xml]
----

<config>
    <TCP bind_port="7800" />
    <TCPGOSSIP timeout="3000" initial_hosts="${GossipRouterAddress}" num_initial_members="3" />
...
...
</config>

----

More on Gossip Router @ link:http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-10890[http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JGroupsGossipRouter]

==== S3_PING
Finally you can configure your JGroups instances to use a shared storage to exchange the details of the cluster nodes. S3_PING was added to JGroups in 2.6.12 and 2.8, and allows the Amazon S3 to be used as the shared storage. It is experimental at the moment but offers another method of clustering without a central server. Be sure that you have signed up for Amazon S3 as well as EC2 to use this method.

.Sample S3PING configuration
[source,xml]
----
<config>
    <TCP bind_port="7800" />
    <S3_PING
            secret_access_key="replace this with you secret access key"
            access_key="replace this with your access key"
            location="replace this with your S3 bucket location" />
</config>

----

==== JDBC_PING
A similar approach to S3_PING, but using a JDBC connection to a shared database. On EC2 that is quite easy using Amazon RDS. See the link:http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JDBCPING[JDBC_PING Wiki page] for details.

=== Kubernetes and OpenShift

Since OpenShift uses Kubernetes underneath both of them can use the same discovery protocol - link:https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes[Kube_PING]. The configuration is very straightforward:

.Sample KUBE_PING configuration
[source,xml]
----

<config>
    <TCP bind_addr="${match-interface:eth.*}" />
    <kubernetes.KUBE_PING />
...
...
</config>

----

The most important thing is to bind JGroups to `eth0` interface, which is link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/[used by Docker containers for network communication].

KUBE_PING protocol is configured by environmental variables (which should be available inside a container). The most important thing is to set `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` to proper namespace. It might be either hardcoded or populated via link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/release-1.0/docs/user-guide/downward-api[Kubernetes' Downward API].

Since KUBE_PING uses Kubernetes API for obtaining available Pods, OpenShift requires adding additional privileges. Assuming that `oc project -q` returns current namespace and `default` is the service account name, one needs to run:

.Adding additional OpenShift privileges
[source,bash]
----

oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)

----

After performing all above steps, the clustering should be enabled and all Pods should automatically form a cluster within a single namespace.

==== Using Kubernetes and OpenShift Rolling Updates

Since Pods in Kubernetes and OpenShift are immutable, the only way to alter the configuration is to roll out a new deployment. There are several
different strategies to do that but we suggest using link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#when-to-use-a-rolling-deployment[Rolling Updates].

An example Deployment Configuration (Kubernetes uses very similar concept called `Deployment`) looks like the following:

.DeploymentConfiguration for Rolling Updates
[source,yaml]
----

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: DeploymentConfig
  metadata:
    name: infinispan-cluster
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    strategy:
      type: Rolling
      rollingParams:
        updatePeriodSeconds: 10
        intervalSeconds: 20
        timeoutSeconds: 600
        maxUnavailable: 1
        maxSurge: 1
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - args:
          - -Djboss.default.jgroups.stack=kubernetes
          image: jboss/infinispan-server:latest
          name: infinispan-server
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8181
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 9990
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 11211
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 11222
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 57600
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 7600
            protocol: TCP
          - containerPort: 8080
            protocol: TCP
          env:
          - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom: {fieldRef: {apiVersion: v1, fieldPath: metadata.namespace}}
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 90
          livenessProbe:
            exec:
              command:
              - /usr/local/bin/is_running.sh
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 80
            periodSeconds: 60
            successThreshold: 1
            failureThreshold: 5
          readinessProbe:
             exec:
                command:
                - /usr/local/bin/is_healthy.sh
             initialDelaySeconds: 10
             timeoutSeconds: 40
             periodSeconds: 30
             successThreshold: 2
             failureThreshold: 5

----

It is also highly recommended to adjust the JGroups stack to discover new nodes (or leaves) more quickly. One should at least
adjust the value of `FD_ALL` timeout and adjust it to the longest GC Pause.

.Other hints for tuning configuration parameters are:
* OpenShift should replace running nodes one by one. This can be achieved by adjusting `rollingParams` (`maxUnavailable: 1` and `maxSurge: 1`).
* Depending on the cluster size, one needs to adjust `updatePeriodSeconds` and `intervalSeconds`. The bigger cluster size is, the bigger those values should be used.
* When using Initial State Transfer, the `initialDelaySeconds` value for both probes should be set to higher value.
* During Initial State Transfer nodes might not respond to probes. The best results are achieved with higher values of `failureThreshold` and `successThreshold` values.

==== Rolling upgrades with Kubernetes and OpenShift

Even though Rolling Upgrades and Rolling Update may sound similarly, they mean different things. The link:$$https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#rolling-strategy[Rolling Update]
is a process of replacing old Pods with new ones. In other words it is a process of rolling out new version of an application. A typical example is a configuration change. Since Pods are immutable, Kubernetes/OpenShift needs to replace them one by one
in order to use the updated configuration bits. On the other hand the <<_Rolling_chapter,Rolling Upgrade>> is a process of migrating data from one Infinispan cluster to another one.
A typical example is migrating from one version to another.

For both Kubernetes and OpenShift, the Rolling Upgrade procedure is almost the same. It is based on a standard <<_Rolling_chapter,Rolling Upgrade procedure>> with small changes.

.Key differences when upgrading using OpenShift/Kubernetes are:
* Depending on configuration, it is a good practice to use link:$$https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html$$[OpenShift Routes] or link:$$http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress$$[Kubernetes Ingress API] to expose services to the clients. During the upgrade the Route (or Ingress) used by the clients can be altered to point to the new cluster.
* Invoking CLI commands can be done by using Kubernetes (`kubectl exec`) or OpenShift clients (`oc exec`). Here is an example: `oc exec <POD_NAME> -- '/opt/jboss/infinispan-server/bin/ispn-cli.sh' '-c' '--controller=$(hostname -i):9990' '/subsystem=datagrid-infinispan/cache-container=clustered/distributed-cache=default:disconnect-source(migrator-name=hotrod)'`

.Key differences when upgrading using the library mode:
* Client application needs to expose JMX. It usually depends on application and environment type but the easiest way to do it is to add the following switches into the Java boostrap script `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<PORT>`.
* Connecting to the JMX can be done by forwarding ports. With OpenShift this might be achieved by using `oc port-forward` command whereas in Kubernetes by `kubectl port-forward`.

The last step in the Rolling Upgrade (removing a Remote Cache Store) needs to be performed differently. We need to use link:$$http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/rolling-updates/$$[Kubernetes/OpenShift Rolling update] command and replace Pods configuration with the one which does not contain Remote Cache Store.
