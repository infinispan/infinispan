== Clustered Counters

Clustered counters is a new building block introduced in Infinispan 9.
It is a counter distributed and shared among all nodes in the Infinispan cluster and it provides counters with
different consistency levels: strong and weak.

Although strong/weak consistent counter has a separate interfaces, both support updating its value,
return the current value and they provide events when its value is updated.
Details are provided below in this document to help you choose which one fits best your uses-case.

=== Installation and Configuration

In order to start using the counters, you needs to add the dependency in your Maven `pom.xml` file:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
   <artifactId>infinispan-clustered-counter</artifactId>
   <version>...</version> <!-- 9.0.0.Final or higher -->
</dependency>
----

The counters can be configured Infinispan configuration file or on-demand via the `CounterManager` interface detailed
later in this document.
A counters configured in Infinispan configuration file is created at boot time when the `EmbeddedCacheManager` is starting.
Theses counters are started eagerly and they are available in all the cluster's nodes.

.configuration.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<infinispan>
    <cache-container ...>
        <!-- if needed to persist counter, global state needs to be configured -->
        <global-state>
            ...
        </global-state>
        <!-- your caches configuration goes here -->
         <counters xmlns="urn:infinispan:config:counters:9.0" num-owners="3" reliability="CONSISTENT">
             <strong-counter name="c1" initial-value="1" storage="PERSISTENT"/>
             <strong-counter name="c2" initial-value="2" storage="VOLATILE">
                 <lower-bound value="0"/>
             </strong-counter>
             <strong-counter name="c3" initial-value="3" storage="PERSISTENT">
                 <upper-bound value="5"/>
             </strong-counter>
             <strong-counter name="c4" initial-value="4" storage="VOLATILE">
                 <lower-bound value="0"/>
                 <upper-bound value="10"/>
             </strong-counter>
             <weak-counter name="c5" initial-value="5" storage="PERSISTENT" concurrency-level="1"/>
         </counters>
    </cache-container>
</infinispan>
----

or programmatically, in the `GlobalConfigurationBuilder`:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfigurationBuilder globalConfigurationBuilder = ...;
CounterManagerConfigurationBuilder builder = globalConfigurationBuilder.addModule(CounterManagerConfigurationBuilder.class);
builder.numOwner(3).reliability(Reliability.CONSISTENT);
builder.addStrongCounter().name("c1").initialValue(1).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT);
builder.addStrongCounter().name("c2").initialValue(2).lowerBound(0).storage(Storage.VOLATILE);
builder.addStrongCounter().name("c3").initialValue(3).upperBound(5).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT);
builder.addStrongCounter().name("c4").initialValue(4).lowerBound(0).upperBound(10).storage(Storage.VOLATILE);
builder.addWeakCounter().name("c5").initialValue(5).concurrencyLevel(1).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT);
----

On other hand, the counters can be configured on-demand, at any time after the `EmbeddedCacheManager` is initialized.

[source,java]
----
CounterManager manager = ...;
manager.defineCounter("c1", CounterConfiguration.builder(CounterType.UNBOUNDED_STRONG).initialValue(1).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT)build());
manager.defineCounter("c2", CounterConfiguration.builder(CounterType.BOUNDED_STRONG).initialValue(2).lowerBound(0).storage(Storage.VOLATILE).build());
manager.defineCounter("c3", CounterConfiguration.builder(CounterType.BOUNDED_STRONG).initialValue(3).upperBound(5).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT).build());
manager.defineCounter("c4", CounterConfiguration.builder(CounterType.BOUNDED_STRONG).initialValue(4).lowerBound(0).upperBound(10).storage(Storage.VOLATILE).build());
manager.defineCounter("c2", CounterConfiguration.builder(CounterType.WEAK).initialValue(5).concurrencyLevel(1).storage(Storage.PERSISTENT).build());
----

NOTE: `CounterConfiguration` is immutable and can be reused.

The method `defineCounter()` will return `true` if the counter is successful configured or `false` otherwise.
However, if the configuration is invalid, the method will throw a `CounterConfigurationException`.
To find out if a counter is already defined, use the method `isDefined()`.

[source,java]
----
CounterManager manager = ...
if (!manager.isDefined("someCounter")) {
    manager.define("someCounter", ...);
}
----

*Per cluster attributes:*

* `num-owners`: Sets the number of counter's copies to keep cluster-wide.
A smaller number will make update operations faster but will support a lower number of server crashes.
It *must be positive* and its default value is `2`.

* `reliability`: Sets the counter's update behavior in a network partition.
Default value is `AVAILABLE` and valid values are:

** `AVAILABLE`: all partitions are able to read and update the counter's value.
** `CONSISTENT`: only the primary partition (majority of nodes) will be able to read and update the counter's value.
The remaining partitions can only read its value.

*Per counter attributes:*

* `initial-value` [common]: Sets the counter's initial value.
Default is `0` (zero).

* `storage` [common]: Sets the counter's behavior when the cluster is shutdown and restarted.
Default value is ``VOLATILE`` and valid values are:
** `VOLATILE`: the counter's value is only available in memory.
The value will be lost when a cluster is shutdown.
** `PERSISTENT`: the counter's value is stored in a private and local persistent store.
The value is kept when the cluster is shutdown and restored after a restart.

NOTE: On-demand and `VOLATILE` counters will lose its value and configuration after a cluster shutdown.
They must be defined again after the restart.

* `lower-bound` [strong]: Sets the strong consistent counter's lower bound.
Default value is `Long.MIN_VALUE`.

* `upper-bound` [strong]: Sets the strong consistent counter's upper bound.
Default value is `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

NOTE: If neither the `lower-bound` or `upper-bound` are configured, the strong counter is set as unbounded.

WARN: the `initial-value` must be between `lower-bound` and `upper-bound` inclusive.

* `concurrency-level` [weak]: Sets the number of concurrent updates.
Its value *must be positive* and the default value is `64`.

=== The `CounterManager` interface.

The `CounterManager` interface is the entry point to define and retrieve a counter.
It automatically listen to the creation of `EmbeddedCacheManager` and proceeds with the registration  of an
instance of it per `EmbeddedCacheManager`.
It starts the caches needed to store the counter state and configures the default counters.

Retrieving the `CounterManager` is as simple as invoke the
`EmbeddedCounterManagerFactory.asCounterManager(EmbeddedCacheManager)`
as shown in the example below:

[source,java]
----
// create or obtain your EmbeddedCacheManager
EmbeddedCacheManager manager = ...;

// retrieve the CounterManager
CounterManager counterManager = EmbeddedCounterManagerFactory.asCounterManager(manager);
----

=== The Counter

A counter can be strong (`StrongCounter`) or weakly consistent (``WeakCounter``) and both is identified by a name.
They have a specific interface but they share some logic, namely, both of them are asynchronous
( a `CompletableFuture` is returned by each operation), provide an update event and can be reset to its initial value.

The following methods are common to both interfaces:

[source,java]
----
String getName();
CompletableFuture<Long> getValue();
long weakGetValue()
CompletableFuture<Void> reset();
<T extends CounterListener> Handle<T> addListener(T listener);
CounterConfiguration getConfiguration();
----

* `getName()` returns the counter name (identifier).
* `getValue()` returns the current counter's value.
* `reset()` allows to reset the counter's value to its initial value.
* `weakGetValue()` is a weak version of ``getValue()`` and it uses a local copy (like a L1 cache)
of the counter's value as return.
Since the counter is distributed, `getValue()` may go remote and the `weakGetValue() always used the local copy.
The local copy is updated asynchronously via events.

NOTE: The `weakGetValue()` will return an old snapshot of the counter value and it may no include the most recent
operations performed locally. On other hand, the `getValue()` may not return concurrent unfinished update
operations.

* `addListener()` register a listener to receive update events.
More details about it in the <<Notifications,Notification section>>.
* `getConfiguration()` returns the configuration used by the counter.

==== The `StrongCounter` interface: when the consistency or bounds matters.

The strong counter provides uses a single key stored in Infinispan cache to provide the consistency needed.
All the updates are performed under the key lock to updates its values.
On other hand, the reads don't acquire any locks and reads the current value.
Also, with this scheme, it allows to bound the counter value and provide atomic operations like compare-and-set.

A `StrongCounter` can be retrieved from the `CounterManager` by using the `getStrongCounter()` method.
As an example:

[source,java]
----
CounterManager counterManager = ...
StrongCounter aCounter = counterManager.getStrongCounter("my-counter);
----

WARN: Since every operation will hit a single key, the `StrongCounter` has a higher contention rate.

The `StrongCounter` interface adds the following method:

[source,java]
----
default CompletableFuture<Long> incrementAndGet() {
   return addAndGet(1L);
}

default CompletableFuture<Long> decrementAndGet() {
   return addAndGet(-1L);
}

CompletableFuture<Long> addAndGet(long delta);

CompletableFuture<Boolean> compareAndSet(long expect, long update);
----

* `incrementAndGet()` increments the counter by one and returns the new value.
* `decrementAndGet()` decrements the counter by one and returns the new value.
* `addAndGet()` adds a delta to the counter's value and returns the new value.
* `compareAndSet()` atomically sets the counter's value if the current value is the expected.

NOTE: A operation is considered completed when the ``CompletableFuture`` is completed.

===== Bounded `StrongCounter`

When bounded, all the update method above will throw a ``CounterOutOfBoundsException`` when they reached the
lower or upper bound.
The exception has the following methods to check which side bound has been reached:

[source,java]
----
public boolean isUpperBoundReached();
public boolean isLowerBoundReached();
----

===== Uses cases

The strong counter fits better in the following uses cases:

* When counter's value is needed after each update (example, cluster-wise ids generator or sequences)
* When a bounded counter is needed (example, rate limiter)

===== Usage Examples

[source,java]
----
StrongCounter counter = counterManager.getStrongCounter("unbounded_coutner");

// incrementing the counter
System.out.println("new value is " + counter.incrementAndGet().get());

// decrement the counter's value by 100 using the functional API
counter.addAndGet(-100).thenApply(v -> {
   System.out.println("new value is " + v);
   return null;
}).get

// alternative, you can do some work while the counter is updated
CompletableFuture<Long> f = counter.addAndGet(10);
// ... do some work ...
System.out.println("new value is " + f.get());

// and then, check the current value
System.out.println("current value is " + counter.getValue().get());

// finally, reset to initial value
counter.reset().get();
System.out.println("current value is " + counter.getValue().get());

// or set to a new value if zero
System.out.println("compare and set succeeded? " + counter.compareAndSet(0, 1));
----

And below, there is another example using a bounded counter:

[source,java]
----
StrongCounter counter = counterManager.getStrongCounter("bounded_counter");

// incrementing the counter
try {
    System.out.println("new value is " + counter.addAndGet(100).get());
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    Throwable cause = e.getCause();
    if (cause instanceof CounterOutOfBoundsException) {
       if (((CounterOutOfBoundsException) cause).isUpperBoundReached()) {
          System.out.println("ops, upper bound reached.");
       } else if (((CounterOutOfBoundsException) cause).isLowerBoundReached()) {
          System.out.println("ops, lower bound reached.");
       }
    }
}

// now using the functional API
counter.addAndGet(-100).handle((v, throwable) -> {
   if (throwable != null) {
      Throwable cause = throwable.getCause();
      if (cause instanceof CounterOutOfBoundsException) {
         if (((CounterOutOfBoundsException) cause).isUpperBoundReached()) {
            System.out.println("ops, upper bound reached.");
         } else if (((CounterOutOfBoundsException) cause).isLowerBoundReached()) {
            System.out.println("ops, lower bound reached.");
         }
      }
      return null;
   }
   System.out.println("new value is " + v);
   return null;
}).get();
----

==== The `WeakCounter` interface: when speed is needed

The `WeakCounter` stores the counter's value in multiple keys in Infinispan cache.
The number of keys created is configured by the `concurrency-level` attribute.
Each key stores a partial state of the counter's value and it can be updated concurrently.
It main advantage over the `StrongCounter` is the lower contention in the cache.
On other hand, the read of its value is more expensive and bounds are not allowed.

WARN: The reset operation should be handled with caution.
It is *not* atomic and it produces intermediates values.
These value may be seen by a read operation and by any listener registered.

A `WeakCounter` can be retrieved from the `CounterManager` by using the `getWeakCounter()` method.
As an example:

[source,java]
----
CounterManager counterManager = ...
StrongCounter aCounter = counterManager.getWeakCounter("my-counter);
----

===== Weak Counter Interface

The `WeakCounter` adds the following methods:

[source,java]
----
default CompletableFuture<Void> increment() {
   return add(1L);
}

default CompletableFuture<Void> decrement() {
   return add(-1L);
}

CompletableFuture<Void> add(long delta);
----

They are similar to the `StrongCounter`'s methods but they don't return the new value.

===== Uses cases

The weak counter fits best in uses cases where the result of the update operation is not needed or the counter's value
is not required too often.
Collecting statistics is a good example of such an use case.

===== Examples

Below, there is an example of the weak counter usage.

[source,java]
----
WeakCounter counter = counterManager.getWeakCounter("my_counter");

// increment the counter and check its result
counter.increment().get();
System.out.println("current value is " + counter.getValue().get());

CompletableFuture<Void> f = counter.add(-100);
//do some work
f.get(); //wait until finished
System.out.println("current value is " + counter.getValue().get());

//using the functional API
counter.reset().whenComplete((aVoid, throwable) -> System.out.println("Reset done " + (throwable == null ? "successfully" : "unsuccessfully"))).get();
System.out.println("current value is " + counter.getValue().get());
----

=== Notifications and Events

Both strong and weak counter supports a listener to receive its updates events.
The listener must implement `CounterListener` and it can be registerer by the following method:

[source,java]
----
<T extends CounterListener> Handle<T> addListener(T listener);
----

The `CounterLister` has the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface CounterListener {
   void onUpdate(CounterEvent entry);
}
----

The `Handle` object returned has the main goal to remove the `CounterListener` when it is not longer needed.
Also, it allows to have access to the `CounterListener` instance that is it handling.
It has the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Handle<T extends CounterListener> {
   T getCounterListener();
   void remove();
}
----

Finally, the `CounterEvent` has the previous and current value and state.
It has the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface CounterEvent {
   long getOldValue();
   State getOldState();
   long getNewValue();
   State getNewState();
}
----

NOTE: The state is always `State.VALID` for unbounded strong counter and weak counter.
`State.LOWER_BOUND_REACHED` and `State.UPPER_BOUND_REACHED` are only valid for bounded strong counters.

WARN: The weak counter `reset()` operation will trigger multiple notification with intermediate values.
