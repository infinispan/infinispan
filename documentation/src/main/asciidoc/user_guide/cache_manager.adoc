== The Embedded CacheManager
The CacheManager is {brandname}'s main entry point. You use a CacheManager to

* configure and obtain caches
* manage and monitor your nodes
* execute code across a cluster
* more...

Depending on whether you are embedding {brandname} in your application or you are using it remotely, you will be
dealing with either an `EmbeddedCacheManager` or a `RemoteCacheManager`. While they share some methods and properties,
be aware that there are semantic differences between them. The following chapters focus mostly on the _embedded_
implementation. For details on the _remote_ implementation refer to <<hotrod:java-client>>.

CacheManagers are heavyweight objects, and we foresee no more than one CacheManager being used per JVM
(unless specific setups require more than one; but either way, this would be a minimal and finite
number of instances).

The simplest way to create a CacheManager is:

[source,java]
----

EmbeddedCacheManager manager = new DefaultCacheManager();

----

which starts the most basic, local mode, non-clustered cache manager with no caches. CacheManagers have a lifecycle
and the default constructors also call link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#start--[start()].
Overloaded versions of the constructors are available, that do not start the CacheManager, although keep in
mind that CacheManagers need to be started before they can be used to create Cache instances.

Once constructed, CacheManagers should be made available to any component that require to interact with it via some form
of application-wide scope such as JNDI, a ServletContext or via some other mechanism such as an IoC container.

When you are done with a CacheManager, you must stop it so that it can release its resources:

[source,java]
----

manager.stop();

----

This will ensure all caches within its scope are properly stopped, thread pools are shutdown. If the CacheManager was
clustered it will also leave the cluster gracefully.

=== Obtaining caches

Once you have configured the CacheManager, the main thing you will want to do is to use it to control and obtain caches.
The main way to get to a cache is to just invoke
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getCache--[getCache()]:

[source,java]
----

Cache<String, String> myCache = manager.getCache("myCache");

----

The above code will create the cache `myCache` (if it doesn't already exist) and return it. One important thing to
remember is that using this method, cache creation is only performed on the local node. This means that, in order for
the cache to exist on all nodes, this operation must be invoked locally everywhere. In a typical application deployed
across multiple nodes, where you obtain caches during initialization, this ensures that the caches are _symmetric_, i.e.
they exist on every node.

If you need to create caches dynamically across the whole cluster, you should invoke the following operation:

[source,java]
----

Cache<String, String> myCache = manager.administration().createCache("myCache", "myTemplate");

----

Caches created using the above API will also be automatically created on any new nodes which subsequently join the cluster.
The configuration of such caches, however, will be ephemeral: shutting down the entire cluster and restarting it will not
automatically recreate them. To make these caches permanent, i.e. ensure that they are recreated after a cluster is
shutdown and restarted, use the +PERMANENT+ flag as follows:

[source,java]
----

Cache<String, String> myCache = manager.administration().withFlags(AdminFlag.PERMANENT).createCache("myCache", "myTemplate");

----

In order for the above to work, global state must be enabled and a suitable configuration storage selected.
The available configuration stores are:

- `VOLATILE`: as the name implies, this configuration storage does not support +PERMANENT+ caches.
- `OVERLAY`: this stores configurations in the global shared state persistent path in a file named _caches.xml_.
- `MANAGED`: this is only supported in server deployments, and will store +PERMANENT+ caches in the server model.
- `CUSTOM`: a custom configuration store.

See link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/configuration/global/GlobalStateConfigurationBuilder.html#configurationStorage-org.infinispan.globalstate.ConfigurationStorage-[GlobalStateConfigurationBuilder#configurationStorage()]
for details.

=== Clustering Information
The `EmbeddedCacheManager` has quite a few methods to provide information
as to how the cluster is operating.  The following methods only really make
sense when being used in a clustered environment (that is when a Transport
is configured).

==== Member Information
When you are using a cluster it is very important to be able to find information
about membership in the cluster including who is the owner of the cluster.

.link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getMembers--[getMembers()]
The +getMembers()+ method returns all of the nodes in the current cluster.

.link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getCoordinator--[getCoordinator()]
The +getCoordinator()+ method will tell you which one of the members is the coordinator
of the cluster.  For most intents you shouldn't need to care who the coordinator is.
You can use link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#isCoordinator--[isCoordinator()]
method directly to see if the local node is the coordinator as well.

==== Other methods

.link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getTransport--[getTransport()]
This method provides you access to the underlying Transport that is used to send
messages to other nodes.  In most cases a user wouldn't ever need to go to
this level, but if you want to get Transport specific information (in this
case JGroups) you can use this mechanism.

.link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/manager/EmbeddedCacheManager.html#getStats--[getStats()]
The stats provided here are coalesced from all of the active caches in this manager.
These stats can be useful to see if there is something wrong going on with your
cluster overall.
