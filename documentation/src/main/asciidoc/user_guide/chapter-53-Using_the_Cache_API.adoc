== The Cache APIs

=== The Cache interface
Infinispan exposes a simple, link:http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107] compliant link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[Cache] interface.

The Cache interface exposes simple methods for adding, retrieving and removing entries, including atomic mechanisms exposed by the JDK's ConcurrentMap interface.  Based on the cache mode used, invoking these methods will trigger a number of things to happen, potentially even including replicating an entry to a remote node or looking up an entry from a remote node, or potentially a cache store.

NOTE: For simple usage, using the Cache API should be no different from using the JDK Map API, and hence migrating from simple in-memory caches based on a Map to Infinispan's Cache should be trivial.

==== Performance Concerns of Certain Map Methods
Certain methods exposed in Map have certain performance consequences when used with Infinispan, such as 
link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#size%28%29[size()] , 
link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#values%28%29[values()] , 
link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#keySet%28%29[keySet()] and 
link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#entrySet%28%29[entrySet()] .  
Specific methods on the `keySet`, `values` and `entrySet` are fine for use please see their Javadoc for further details.

Attempting to perform these operations globally would have large performance impact as well as become a scalability bottleneck.  As such, these methods should only be used for informational or debugging purposes only.

It should be noted that using certain flags with the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#withFlags%28org.infinispan.context.Flag...%29[withFlags] method can mitigate some of these concerns, please check each method's documentation for more details.

==== Mortal and Immortal Data
Further to simply storing entries, Infinispan's cache API allows you to attach mortality information to data.  For example, simply using link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put%28K,%20V%29[put(key, value)] would create an _immortal_ entry, i.e., an entry that lives in the cache forever, until it is removed (or evicted from memory to prevent running out of memory).  If, however, you put data in the cache using link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#put%28K,%20V,%20long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit%29[put(key, value, lifespan, timeunit)] , this creates a _mortal_ entry, i.e., an entry that has a fixed lifespan and expires after that lifespan.

In addition to _lifespan_ , Infinispan also supports _maxIdle_ as an additional metric with which to determine expiration.  Any combination of lifespans or maxIdles can be used. 

==== Example of Using Expiry and Mortal Data
See <<_eviction_examples, these examples>> of using mortal data with Infinispan. 

==== putForExternalRead operation
Infinispan's link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[Cache] class contains a different 'put' operation called link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#putForExternalRead(K, V)[putForExternalRead] . This operation is particularly useful when Infinispan is used as a temporary cache for data that is persisted elsewhere.  Under heavy read scenarios, contention in the cache should not delay the real transactions at hand, since caching should just be an optimization and not something that gets in the way.

To achieve this, putForExternalRead acts as a put call that only operates if the key is not present in the cache, and fails fast and silently if another thread is trying to store the same key at the same time. In this particular scenario, caching data is a way to optimise the system and it's not desirable that a failure in caching affects the on-going transaction, hence why failure is handled differently. putForExternalRead is consider to be a fast operation because regardless of whether it's successful or not, it doesn't wait for any locks, and so returns to the caller promptly.

To understand how to use this operation, let's look at basic example. Imagine a cache of Person instances, each keyed by a PersonId , whose data originates in a separate data store. The following code shows the most common pattern of using link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#putForExternalRead(K, V)[putForExternalRead] within the context of this example:

[source,java]
----

// Id of the person to look up, provided by the application
PersonId id = ...;

// Get a reference to the cache where person instances will be stored
Cache<PersonId, Person> cache = ...;

// First, check whether the cache contains the person instance
// associated with with the given id
Person cachedPerson = cache.get(id);

if (cachedPerson == null) {
   // The person is not cached yet, so query the data store with the id
   Person person = dataStore.lookup(id);

   // Cache the person along with the id so that future requests can
   // retrieve it from memory rather than going to the data store
   cache.putForExternalRead(id, person);
} else {
   // The person was found in the cache, so return it to the application
   return cachedPerson;
}

----

Please note that link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#putForExternalRead(K, V)[putForExternalRead] should never be used as a mechanism to update the cache with a new Person instance originating from application execution (i.e. from a transaction that modifies a Person's address). When updating cached values, please use the standard link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put(K, V)[put] operation, otherwise the possibility of caching corrupt data is likely.

=== The AdvancedCache interface
In addition to the simple Cache interface, Infinispan offers an link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html[AdvancedCache] interface, geared towards extension authors.  The AdvancedCache offers the ability to inject custom interceptors, access certain internal components and to apply flags to alter the default behavior of certain cache methods.  The following code snippet depicts how an AdvancedCache can be obtained:

[source,java]
----
AdvancedCache advancedCache = cache.getAdvancedCache();

----


==== Flags
Flags are applied to regular cache methods to alter the behavior of certain methods.  For a list of all available flags, and their effects, see the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html[Flag] enumeration.  Flags are applied using link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#withFlags%28org.infinispan.context.Flag...%29[AdvancedCache.withFlags()] .  This builder method can be used to apply any number of flags to a cache invocation, for example:

[source,java]
----
advancedCache.withFlags(Flag.CACHE_MODE_LOCAL, Flag.SKIP_LOCKING)
   .withFlags(Flag.FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS)
   .put("hello", "world");


----

==== Entry Retrieval

It is possible to retrieve all of the entries stored in a given cache, irrespective of its clustering configuration.
These entries are only retrieved through an iterator where each value is only returned one at a time.
This is done because of the possible memory constraints of pulling all the values into a single node at the same time.

An `EntryIterable` is available by invoking the 
link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#filterEntries(org.infinispan.filter.KeyValueFilter)[filterEntries]
method on `AdvancedCache`.  Note you are required to provide a `KeyValueFilter`, this is to make sure users realize this can be an expensive operation and by filtering entries on the remote side will allow the operation to perform faster and more efficiently.
This allows you to iterate over the contents in the cache in a memory sensitive way so out of memory errors should not occur.
The size of contents held in memory by the iterator while being processed currently is limited by the state transfer chunk size configuration value.

Once the `EntryIterable` is retrieved, invocation of the iterator method will immediately start retrieving entries.  Note each invocation of the iterator method will start a brand new entry request thus allowing the `Iterable` to be reused.

`EntryIterable` also implements `AutoCloseable` so it should be done in a try with resource block to ensure that all resources can be closed properly after invocation.

[source,java]
----
KeyValueFilter<Object, Object> filter = ...
try (EntryIterable<Object, Object> iterable = advancedCache.filterEntries(filter)) {
  for (CacheEntry<Object, Object> entry : iterable) {
     // Do something
  }
}
----

===== Transactional Aware
The iterators produced will obey the current transaction if there is one when they are generated.  Note the transaction they use is the one that is found to be in the thread when `filterEntries` is first invoked.  Thus you should only access this iterator from the same thread or else undefind behavior may occur.

Since we cannot put all entries into the local transaction any entries retrieved using the iterator are not added to the transaction context.  This means that the iterator will behave always in a way similar to a Read Committed isolation level even if Repeatable Read is enabled for example.  If an entry was previously put in the context it will use this value, including if it was removed, in which case it will not be returned from the iterator.


===== Iterator remove
We also do support the remove operation on the iterator.  In a non transactional cache this will immediately remove the key from the cache.  In a transactional cache this will instead be added to the existing transaction context if there is one otherwise an implicit transaction will be generated for it.

===== Value conversion

While the provided filter can be used to efficiently reduce what entries are returned to the local node, there is also the possibility of providing an optional link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/filter/Converter.html[Converter] which will convert the provided value to another object or even type, which is done on the remote side.  This is useful to reduce payload size when you may want only a partial view of the object or even an object that is created from it.

In this case we have a converter that can be used to convert a Car instance to instead return one of its wheels as determined by the value passed to the converter when created.

[source,java]
----
public class CarWheelConverter implements Converter<String, Car, Wheel> {
   private final int wheelPosition;

   public CarWheelConverter(int wheelPosition) {
     this.wheelPosition = wheelPosition;
   }
   @Override
   public Wheel convert(String key, Car value, Metadata metadata) {
      return value.getWheels().wheel(wheelPosition);
   }
}


try (CloseableIterable<CacheEntry<String, Wheel>> iterable = advancedCache.filterEntries(teslaCarFilter).converter(new CarWheelConverter(3)) {
   for (CacheEntry<String, Wheel> entry : iterable) {
      // Do something with the third wheel of the car
   }
}
----

NOTE: Remember that both the `KeyValueFilter` and the `Converter` must either implement `Serializable` or have a provided Infinispan `Externalizer`

==== Custom Interceptors

The AdvancedCache interface also offers advanced developers a mechanism with which to attach custom interceptors.  Custom interceptors allow developers to alter the behavior of the cache API methods, and the AdvancedCache interface allows developers to attach these interceptors programmatically, at run-time.  See the AdvancedCache Javadocs for more details.

For more information on writing custom interceptors, see <<_custom_interceptors_chapter, this chapter>>.

[[_Listeners_and_notifications_section]]
===  Listeners and Notifications

Infinispan offers a listener API, where clients can register for and get notified when events take place.  This annotation-driven API applies to 2 different levels: cache level events and cache manager level events.

Events trigger a notification which is dispatched to listeners.   Listeners are simple link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object[POJO] s annotated with link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/Listener.html[@Listener] and registered using the methods defined in the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/Listenable.html[Listenable] interface.

NOTE: Both Cache and CacheManager implement Listenable, which means you can attach listeners to either a cache or a cache manager, to receive either cache-level or cache manager-level notifications.

For example, the following class defines a listener to print out some information every time a new entry is added to the cache: 

[source,java]
----
@Listener
public class PrintWhenAdded {

  @CacheEntryCreated
  public void print(CacheEntryCreatedEvent event) {
    System.out.println("New entry " + event.getKey() + " created in the cache");
  }

}

----

For more comprehensive examples, please see the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/Listener.html[Javadocs for @Listener].


==== Cache-level notifications
Cache-level events occur on a per-cache basis, and by default are only raised on nodes where the events occur.  Note in a distributed cache these events are only raised on the owners of data being affected.  Examples of cache-level events are entries being added, removed, modified, etc.  These events trigger notifications to listeners registered to a specific cache.

Please see the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/cachelistener/annotation/package-summary.html[Javadocs on the org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.annotation package] for a comprehensive list of all cache-level notifications, and their respective method-level annotations.

NOTE: Please refer to the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/cachelistener/annotation/package-summary.html[Javadocs on the org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.annotation package] for the list of cache-level notifications available in Infinispan.

===== Cluster Listeners
The cluster listeners should be used when it is desirable to listen to the cache events on a single node.

To do so all that is required is set to annotate your listener as being clustered.

[source,java]
----
@Listener (clustered = true)
public class MyClusterListener { .... }

----

There are some limitations to cluster listeners from a non clustered listener.

. A cluster listener can only listen to `@CacheEntryModified`, `@CacheEntryCreated` and `@CacheEntryRemoved` events.  Note this means any other type of event will not be listened to for this listener.
. Only the post event is sent to a cluster listener, the pre event is ignored.

===== Event filtering and conversion
All applicable events on the node where the listener is installed will be raised to the listener.  It is possible to dynamically filter what events are raised by using a link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/filter/KeyFilter.html[KeyFilter] (only allows filtering on keys) or link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/cachelistener/filter/CacheEventFilter.html[CacheEventFilter] (used to filter for keys, old value, old metadata, new value, new metadata, whether command was retried, if the event is before the event (ie. isPre) and also the command type).

The example here shows a simple `KeyFilter` that will only allow events to be raised when an event modified the entry for the key `Only Me`.
[source,java]
----
public class SpecificKeyFilter implements KeyFilter<String> {
    private final String keyToAccept;

    public SpecificKeyFilter(String keyToAccept) {
      if (keyToAccept == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException();
      }
      this.keyToAccept = keyToAccept;
    }

    boolean accept(String key) {
      return keyToAccept.equals(key);
    }
}

...
cache.addListener(listener, new SpecificKeyFilter("Only Me"));
...

----

This can be useful when you want to limit what events you receive in a more efficient manner.

There is also a link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/filter/CacheEventConverter.html[CacheEventConverter] that can be supplied that allows for converting a value to another before raising the event.  This can be nice to modularize any code that does value conversions.

NOTE: The mentioned filters and converters are especially beneficial when used in conjunction with a Cluster Listener.  This is because the filtering and conversion is done on the node where the event originated and not on the node where event is listened to.  This can provide benefits of not having to replicate events across the cluster (filter) or even have reduced payloads (converter).

===== Initial State Events
When a listener is installed it will only be notified of events after it is fully installed.

It may be desirable to get the current state of the cache contents upon first registration of listener by having an event generated of type `@CacheEntryCreated` for each element in the cache.  Any additionally generated events during this initial phase will be queued until appropriate events have been raised.

NOTE: This only works for clustered listeners at this time.  link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-4608[ISPN-4608] covers adding this for non clustered listeners.

===== Duplicate Events

It is possible in a non transactional cache to receive duplicate events.  This is possible when the primary owner of a key goes down while trying to perform a write operation such as a put.

Infinispan internally will rectify the put operation by sending it to the new primary owner for the given key automatically, however there are no guarantees in regards to if the write was first replicated to backups.  Thus more than 1 of the following write events (`CacheEntryCreatedEvent`, `CacheEntryModifiedEvent` & `CacheEntryRemovedEvent`) may be sent on a single operation.

If more than one event is generated Infinispan will mark the event that it was generated by a retried command to help the user to know when this occurs without having to pay attention to view changes.

[source,java]
----
@Listener
public class MyRetryListener {
  @CacheEntryModified
  public void entryModified(CacheEntryModifiedEvent event) {
    if (event.isCommandRetried()) {
      // Do something
    }
  }
}
----

Also when using a `CacheEventFilter` or `CacheEventConverter` the link:https://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/cachelistener/filter/EventType.html[EventType] contains a method `isRetry` to tell if the event was generated due to retry.

==== Cache manager-level notifications
Cache manager-level events occur on a cache manager.  These too are global and  cluster-wide, but involve events that affect all caches created by a single cache manager.  Examples of cache manager-level events are nodes joining or leaving a cluster, or caches starting or stopping.

Please see the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/notifications/cachemanagerlistener/annotation/package-summary.html[Javadocs  on the org.infinispan.notifications.cachemanagerlistener.annotation package] for a comprehensive list of all cache manager-level notifications,  and their respective method-level annotations.

==== Synchronicity of events
By default, all notifications are dispatched in the same thread that generates the event.  This means that you _must_ write your listener such that it does not block or do anything that takes too long, as it would prevent the thread from progressing.  Alternatively, you could annotate your listener as _asynchronous_ , in which case a separate thread pool will be used to dispatch the notification and prevent blocking the event originating thread.  To do this, simply annotate your listener such: 

[source,java]
----
@Listener (sync = false)
public class MyAsyncListener { .... }

----

===== Asynchronous thread pool
To tune the thread pool used to dispatch such asynchronous notifications, use the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/configdocs/infinispan-config-{infinispanversion}.html[`<listener-executor />`] XML element in your configuration file.

===  Asynchronous API
In addition to synchronous API methods like link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put%28K,%20V%29[Cache.put()] , link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#remove%28java.lang.Object%29[Cache.remove()] , etc., Infinispan also has an asynchronous, non-blocking API where you can achieve the same results in a non-blocking fashion.

These methods are named in a similar fashion to their blocking counterparts, with "Async" appended.  E.g., link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#putAsync%28K,%20V%29[Cache.putAsync()] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#removeAsync%28java.lang.Object%29[Cache.removeAsync()] , etc.  These asynchronous counterparts return a link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html[Future] containing the actual result of the operation.

For example, in a cache parameterized as `Cache<String, String>`, `Cache.put(String key, String value)` returns a `String`.
`Cache.putAsync(String key, String value)` would return a `Future<String>`.

==== Why use such an API?
Non-blocking APIs are powerful in that they provide all of the guarantees of synchronous communications - with the ability to handle communication failures and exceptions - with the ease of not having to block until a call completes.  This allows you to better harness parallelism in your system.  For example:

[source,java]
----
Set<Future<?>> futures = new HashSet<Future<?>>();
futures.add(cache.putAsync(key1, value1)); // does not block
futures.add(cache.putAsync(key2, value2)); // does not block
futures.add(cache.putAsync(key3, value3)); // does not block

// the remote calls for the 3 puts will effectively be executed
// in parallel, particularly useful if running in distributed mode
// and the 3 keys would typically be pushed to 3 different nodes
// in the cluster

// check that the puts completed successfully
for (Future<?> f: futures) f.get();

----

==== Which processes actually happen asynchronously?
There are 4 things in Infinispan that can be considered to be on the critical path of a typical write operation.
These are, in order of cost:

* network calls
* marshalling
* writing to a cache store (optional)
* locking

As of Infinispan 4.0, using the async methods will take the network calls and marshalling off the critical path.  For various technical reasons, writing to a cache store and acquiring locks, however, still happens in the caller's thread.  In future, we plan to take these offline as well.  See link:http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/infinispan-dev/2010-January/002219.html[this developer mail list thread] about this topic. 

==== Notifying futures
Strictly, these methods do not return JDK Futures, but rather a sub-interface known as a link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/util/concurrent/NotifyingFuture.html[NotifyingFuture] .  The main difference is that you can attach a listener to a NotifyingFuture such that you could be notified when the future completes.  Here is an example of making use of a notifying future:

[source,java]
----

FutureListener futureListener = new FutureListener() {

   public void futureDone(Future future) {
      try {
         future.get();
      } catch (Exception e) {
         // Future did not complete successfully
         System.out.println("Help!");
      }
   }
};
      
cache.putAsync("key", "value").attachListener(futureListener);

----

==== Further reading
The Javadocs on the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html[Cache] interface has some examples on using the asynchronous API, as does link:http://infinispan.blogspot.com/2009/05/whats-so-cool-about-asynchronous-api.html[this article] by Manik Surtani introducing the API.

===  Invocation Flags
An important aspect of getting the most of Infinispan is the use of per-invocation flags in order to provide specific behaviour to each particular cache call. By doing this, some important optimizations can be implemented potentially saving precious time and network resources. One of the most popular usages of flags can be found right in Cache API, underneath the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/Cache.html#putForExternalRead(K, V)[putForExternalRead()] method which is used to load an Infinispan cache with data read from an external resource. In order to make this call efficient, Infinispan basically calls a normal put operation passing the following flags: link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#FAIL_SILENTLY[FAIL_SILENTLY] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#FORCE_ASYNCHRONOUS[FORCE_ASYNCHRONOUS] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html#ZERO_LOCK_ACQUISITION_TIMEOUT[ZERO_LOCK_ACQUISITION_TIMEOUT]

What Infinispan is doing here is effectively saying that when putting data read from external read, it will use an almost-zero lock acquisition time and that if the locks cannot be acquired, it will fail silently without throwing any exception related to lock acquisition. It also specifies that regardless of the cache mode, if the cache is clustered, it will replicate asynchronously and so won't wait for responses from other nodes. The combination of all these flags make this kind of operation very efficient, and the efficiency comes from the fact this type of _putForExternalRead_ calls are used with the knowledge that client can always head back to a persistent store of some sorts to retrieve the data that should be stored in memory. So, any attempt to store the data is just a best effort and if not possible, the client should try again if there's a cache miss.

==== DecoratedCache
Another approach would be to use the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/DecoratedCache.html[DecoratedCache] wrapper.
This allows you to reuse flags. For example: 

[source,java]
----
AdvancedCache cache = ...
DecoratedCache strictlyLocal = new DecoratedCache(cache, Flag.CACHE_MODE_LOCAL, Flag.SKIP_CACHE_STORE);
strictlyLocal.put("local_1", "only");
strictlyLocal.put("local_2", "only");
strictlyLocal.put("local_3", "only");

----

This approach makes your code more readable.

==== Examples
If you want to use these or any other flags available, which by the way are described in detail the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html[Flag enumeration] , you simply need to get hold of the advanced cache and add the flags you need via the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#withFlags(org.infinispan.context.Flag...)[withFlags()] method call. For example:

[source,java]
----
Cache cache = ...
cache.getAdvancedCache()
   .withFlags(Flag.SKIP_CACHE_STORE, Flag.CACHE_MODE_LOCAL)
   .put("local", "only"); 

----

It's worth noting that these flags are only active for the duration of the cache operation. If the same flags need to be used in several invocations, even if they're in the same transaction, link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/AdvancedCache.html#withFlags(org.infinispan.context.Flag...)[withFlags()] needs to be called repeatedly. Clearly, if the cache operation is to be replicated in another node, the flags are carried over to the remote nodes as well.


===== Suppressing return values from a put() or remove()
Another very important use case is when you want a write operation such as put() to _not_ return the previous value. To do that, you need to use two flags to make sure that in a distributed environment, no remote lookup is done to potentially get previous value, and if the cache is configured with a cache loader, to avoid loading the previous value from the cache store. You can see these two flags in action in the following example: 


[source,java]
----
Cache cache = ...
cache.getAdvancedCache()
   .withFlags(Flag.SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP, Flag.SKIP_CACHE_LOAD)
   .put("local", "only")

----

For more information, please check the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/context/Flag.html[Flag enumeration] javadoc.


===  Tree API Module
link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/package-summary.html[Infinispan's tree API module] offers clients the possibility of storing data using a tree-structure like API. This API is similar to the one link:http://docs.jboss.org/jbosscache/3.2.1.GA/apidocs/org/jboss/cache/package-summary.html[provided by JBoss Cache], hence the tree module is perfect for those users wanting to migrate their applications from JBoss Cache to Infinispan, who want to limit changes their codebase as part of the migration. Besides, it's important to understand that Infinispan provides this tree API much more efficiently than JBoss Cache did, so if you're a user of the tree API in JBoss Cache, you should consider migrating to Infinispan.

==== What is Tree API about?
The aim of this API is to store information in a hierarchical way. The hierarchy is defined using paths represented as link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/Fqn.html[Fqn or fully qualified names] , for example: _/this/is/a/fqn/path_ or _/another/path_ . In the hierarchy, there's a special path called root which represents the starting point of all paths and it's represented as: _/_

Each FQN path is represented as a node where users can store data using a key/value pair style API (i.e. a Map). For example, in _/persons/john_ , you could store information belonging to John, for example: surname=Smith, birthdate=05/02/1980...etc. 

Please remember that users should not use root as a place to store data. Instead, users should define their own paths and store data there. The following sections will delve into the practical aspects of this API.

==== Using the Tree API
===== Dependencies
For your application to use the tree API, you need to import infinispan-tree.jar which can be located in the Infinispan binary distributions, or you can simply add a dependency to this module in your pom.xml: 

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----

<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
    <artifactId>infinispan-tree</artifactId>
    <version>$put-infinispan-version-here</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>

==== Creating a Tree Cache
The first step to use the tree API is to actually create a tree cache. To do so, you need to <<_configuring_cache, create an Infinispan Cache as you'd normally do, and using the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCacheFactory.html[TreeCacheFactory] , create an instance of link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html[TreeCache] . A very important note to remember here is that the Cache instance passed to the factory must be configured with <<_batching, invocation batching>>. For example:

[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.config.Configuration;
import org.infinispan.tree.TreeCacheFactory;
import org.infinispan.tree.TreeCache;
...
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.setInvocationBatchingEnabled(true);
Cache cache = new DefaultCacheManager(config).getCache();
TreeCache treeCache = TreeCacheFactory.createTreeCache(cache);

----

==== Manipulating data in a Tree Cache
The Tree API effectively provides two ways to interact with the data:

Via link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html[TreeCache] convenience methods: These methods are located within the TreeCache interface and enable users to link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html#put(java.lang.String, K, V)[store] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html#get(org.infinispan.tree.Fqn, K)[retrieve] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html#move(org.infinispan.tree.Fqn, org.infinispan.tree.Fqn)[move] , link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/TreeCache.html#remove(org.infinispan.tree.Fqn, K)[remove] ...etc data with a single call that takes the link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/Fqn.html[Fqn] , in String or Fqn format, and the data involved in the call. For example:

[source,java]
----
treeCache.put("/persons/john", "surname", "Smith");
----

Or:

[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.tree.Fqn;
...
Fqn johnFqn = Fqn.fromString("persons/john");
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.set(1980, 5, 2);
treeCache.put(johnFqn, "birthdate", calendar.getTime()));

----

Via link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/Node.html[Node] API: It allows finer control over the individual nodes that form the FQN, allowing manipulation of nodes relative to a particular node. For example:

[source,java]
----
import org.infinispan.tree.Node;
...
TreeCache treeCache = ...
Fqn johnFqn = Fqn.fromElements("persons", "john"); 
Node<String, Object> john = treeCache.getRoot().addChild(johnFqn);
john.put("surname", "Smith");

----

Or:

[source,java]
----
Node persons = treeCache.getRoot().addChild(Fqn.fromString("persons"));
Node<String, Object> john = persons.addChild(Fqn.fromString("john"));
john.put("surname", "Smith");

----

Or even:

[source,java]
----
Fqn personsFqn = Fqn.fromString("persons");
Fqn johnFqn = Fqn.fromRelative(personsFqn, Fqn.fromString("john"));
Node<String, Object> john = treeCache.getRoot().addChild(johnFqn);
john.put("surname", "Smith");

----

A node also provides the ability to access its link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/Node.html#getParent()[parent] or link:http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/{infinispanversion}/apidocs/org/infinispan/tree/Node.html#getChildren()[children] . For example:

[source,java]
----
Node<String, Object> john = ...
Node persons = john.getParent();

----

Or:

[source,java]
----
Set<Node<String, Object>> personsChildren = persons.getChildren();
----

==== Common Operations

In the previous section, some of the most used operations, such as addition and retrieval, have been shown. However, there are other important operations that are worth mentioning, such as remove:

You can for example remove an entire node, i.e. _/persons/john_ , using: 

[source,java]
----
treeCache.removeNode("/persons/john");
----

Or remove a child node, i.e. persons that a child of root, via:

[source,java]
----
treeCache.getRoot().removeChild(Fqn.fromString("persons"));
----

You can also remove a particular key/value pair in a node:

[source,java]
----
Node john = treeCache.getRoot().getChild(Fqn.fromElements("persons", "john"));
john.remove("surname");
----

Or you can remove all data in a node with:

[source,java]
----
Node john = treeCache.getRoot().getChild(Fqn.fromElements("persons", "john"));
john.clearData();
----

Another important operation supported by Tree API is the ability to move nodes around in the tree. Imagine we have a node called "john" which is located under root node. The following example is going to show how to we can move "john" node to be under "persons" node:

Current tree structure:

----

   /persons
   /john

----

Moving trees from one FQN to another:

[source,java]
----

Node john = treeCache.getRoot().addChild(Fqn.fromString("john"));
Node persons = treeCache.getRoot().getChild(Fqn.fromString("persons"));
treeCache.move(john.getFqn(), persons.getFqn());

----

Final tree structure:


----

   /persons/john

----

==== Locking in the Tree API
Understanding when and how locks are acquired when manipulating the tree structure is important in order to maximise the performance of any client application interacting against the tree, while at the same time maintaining consistency.

Locking on the tree API happens on a per node basis. So, if you're putting or updating a key/value under a particular node, a write lock is acquired for that node. In such case, no write locks are acquired for parent node of the node being modified, and no locks are acquired for children nodes.

If you're adding or removing a node, the parent is not locked for writing. In JBoss Cache, this behaviour was configurable with the default being that parent was not locked for insertion or removal.

Finally, when a node is moved, the node that's been moved and any of its children are locked, but also the target node and the new location of the moved node and its children. To understand this better, let's look at an example:

Imagine you have a hierarchy like this and we want to move c/ to be underneath b/:


----
        /
      --|--
     /     \
     a     c
     |     |
     b     e
     |
     d

----

The end result would be something like this:


----
        /
        |          
        a     
        |     
        b     
      --|--
     /     \
     d     c
           |
           e

----

To make this move, locks would have been acquired on:


*  _/a/b_ - because it's the parent underneath which the data will be put 


*  _/c_ and _/c/e_ - because they're the nodes that are being moved 


*  _/a/b/c_ and _/a/b/c/e_ - because that's new target location for the nodes being moved

==== Listeners for tree cache events

The current Infinispan listeners have been designed with key/value store notifications in mind, and hence they do not map to tree cache events correctly. Tree cache specific listeners that map directly to tree cache events (i.e. adding a child...etc) are desirable but these are not yet available. If you're interested in this type of listeners, please follow link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-1935[this issue] to find out about any progress in this area.
