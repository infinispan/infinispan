= Infinispan performance considerations and tuning guidelines

Deploying an in-memory, distributed data store requires careful planning.
It also requires you to measure performance over time to learn where boundaries exist and then adjust and tune your deployment.
The details in this guide help you calculate the size of your data set, figure out what type of clustered cache best suits your requirements, and understand performance trade-offs for various Infinispan capabilities.
This guide also includes some practical tuning recommendations to optimize Infinispan performance.
