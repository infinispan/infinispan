= Infinispan Spring Boot Starter

The Spring Boot Starter provides a set of managed transitive dependencies that include everything your project needs to use Infinispan caches.
This starter gives you a convenient way to use Infinispan with Spring Boot but is optional.
You can also simply add Infinispan dependencies to your Spring Boot project.
