= {brandname} Spring Boot Starter

The {brandname} starter provides a set of managed transitive dependencies that
include everything your Spring Boot project needs to seamlessly interact with
{brandname}.

[TIP]
====
The {brandname} Spring Boot starter gives you a convenient way to get started
with Spring Boot but is optional. To use {brandname} with Spring Boot you can
simply add the dependencies you want.
