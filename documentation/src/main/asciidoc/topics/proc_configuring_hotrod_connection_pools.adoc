= Configuring Connection Pools
Hot Rod Java clients keep pools of persistent connections to {brandname}
servers to reuse TCP connections instead of creating them on each request.

Clients use asynchronous threads that check the validity of connections by
iterating over the connection pool and sending pings to {brandname} servers.
This improves performance by finding broken connections while they are idle in
the pool, rather than on application requests.

.Procedure

* Configure Hot Rod client connection pool settings  with the `ConnectionPoolConfigurationBuilder` class.
