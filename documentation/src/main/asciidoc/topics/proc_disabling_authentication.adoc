= Disabling Authentication
In local development environments or on isolated networks you can configure {brandname} to allow unauthenticated client requests.

When you disable user authentication you should also disable authorization in your {brandname} security configuration.

.Procedure

. Open `infinispan.xml` for editing.
. Remove any `security-realm` attributes from the `endpoints` configuration.
. Ensure that the Hot Rod and REST connectors do not include any
`authentication` configuration.
+
For example, the following configuration allows unauthenticated access to
{brandname}:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::xml/endpoints_authentication_disabled.xml[]
----
+
. Remove any `authorization` elements from the `security` configuration for the `cache-container` and each cache configuration.
