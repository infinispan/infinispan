= REST
{brandname} exposes a RESTful interface that allows HTTP clients to access
data, monitor and maintain clusters, and perform administrative operations.

You can use standard HTTP load balancers to provide clients with load
balancing and failover capabilities. However, HTTP load balancers maintain
static cluster views and require manual updates when cluster topology changes
occur.
