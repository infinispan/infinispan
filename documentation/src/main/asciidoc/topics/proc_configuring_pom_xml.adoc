= Configuring your project POM

Configure Project Object Model (POM) files in your project to use {brandname} dependencies for embedded caches, Hot Rod clients, and other capabilities.

.Procedure

. Open your project `pom.xml` for editing.
. Define the `version.infinispan` property with the correct {brandname} version.
. Include the `infinispan-bom` in a `dependencyManagement` section.
+
The Bill Of Materials (BOM) controls dependency versions, which avoids version
conflicts and means you do not need to set the version for each {brandname}
artifact you add as a dependency to your project.
+
. Save and close `pom.xml`.

The following example shows the {brandname} version and BOM:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::dependencies_maven/ispn_bom.xml[]
----

.Next Steps

Add {brandname} artifacts as dependencies to your `pom.xml` as required.
