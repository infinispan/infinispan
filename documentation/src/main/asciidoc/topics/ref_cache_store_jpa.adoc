= JPA Cache Stores
JPA (Java Persistence API) cache stores, `JpaStore`, use formal schema to
persist data. Other applications can then read from persistent storage to load
data from {brandname}. However, other applications should not use persistent
storage concurrently with {brandname}.

When using `JpaStore`, you should take the following into consideration:

* Keys should be the ID of the entity. Values should be the entity object.
* Only a single `@Id` or `@EmbeddedId` annotation is allowed.
* Auto-generated IDs with the `@GeneratedValue` annotation are not supported.
* All entries are stored as immortal.
* `JpaStore` does not support segmentation.
