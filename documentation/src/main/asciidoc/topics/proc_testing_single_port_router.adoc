= Testing the Single-Port router

A tool such as `curl` can be used to access cache using both _cleartext upgrade_ or TLS/ALPN. Here's an example:

[source,bash]
----
include::rest_examples/curl_singleport_test.adoc[]
----

The `--http2-prior-knowledge` can be exchanged with `--http2` switch allowing to control how the switch procedure
is being done (via Plain-Text Upgrade or TLS/ALPN).
