= Enabling Authorization in Cache Configuration
Use authorization in your cache configuration to restrict user access.
Before they can read or write cache entries, or create and delete caches, users must have a role with a sufficient level of permission.

.Procedure

. Open your `infinispan.xml` configuration for editing.
. If it is not already declared, add the `<authorization />` tag inside the `security` elements for the `cache-container`.
+
This enables authorization for the Cache Manager and provides a global set of roles and permissions that caches can inherit.
+
. Add the `<authorization />` tag to each cache for which {brandname} restricts access based on user roles.

The following configuration example shows how to use implicit authorization configuration with default roles and permissions:
