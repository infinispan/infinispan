* link:https://redis.io/commands/expireat[EXPIREAT]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/expiretime[EXPIRETIME]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/flushall[FLUSHALL]
+

* link:https://redis.io/commands/flushdb[FLUSHDB]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/get[GET]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/getdel[GETDEL]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/getex[GETEX]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/getrange[GETRANGE]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/getset[GETSET]
+
NOTE: This command is deprecated. Use the `SET` command with the appropriate flags instead.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/incrby[INCRBY]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/incrbyfloat[INCRBYFLOAT]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/info[INFO]
+
NOTE: This implementation attempts to return all attributes that a real Redis server returns. However, in most cases, the values are set to `0` because they cannot be retrieved, or don't apply to {brandname}.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/keys[KEYS]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/lindex[LINDEX]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/linsert[LINSERT]
+
NOTE: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the list.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/llen[LLEN]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/lcs[LCS]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/lmove[LMOVE]
+
NOTE: The current implementation is atomic for rotation when the source and destination are the same list. For different lists, there is relaxed consistency for concurrent operations or failures unless the resp cache is configured to use transactions.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/ltrim[LTRIM]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/memory-info[MEMORY USAGE]
+ 
NOTE: This command will return the memory used by the key and the value. It doesn't include the memory used by additional metadata associated with the entry.


* link:https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats[MEMORY STATS]
+
NOTE: This command will return the same fields as a real Redis server, but all values will be set to `0`.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/mget[MGET]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/module-list[MODULE LIST]
+
NOTE: This command always returns an empty list of modules.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/mset[MSET]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/msetnx[MSETNX]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/multi[MULTI] [[multi_command]]
+
NOTE: The current implementation has a relaxed isolation level. Redis offers serializable transactions, but {brandname}
provides a read-uncommitted isolation.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/sdiff[SDIFF]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/sdiffstore[SDIFFSTORE]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/select[SELECT]

NOTE: {brandname} allows the SELECT command both in local and clustered mode, unlike Redis Cluster which forbids use of this command and only supports database zero.

NOTE: This command is deprecated. Use the `SET` command with the appropriate flags instead.
