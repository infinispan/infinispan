= Redis commands

The {brandname} RESP endpoint implements the following Redis commands:

[cols="1,1"]

|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/cluster-shards/[CLUSTER SHARDS]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/cluster-nodes/[CLUSTER NODES]
| This commands includes all required fields, some are set to 0 as they do not apply to {{brandname}}.

|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/exists[EXISTS]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/flushall[FLUSHALL]
| Behaves like *FLUSHDB* since {{brandname}} does not support multiple Redis databases yet.

|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/get[GET]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/getdel[GETDEL]

|

|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/incrby[INCRBY]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/incrbyfloat[INCRBYFLOAT]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/info[INFO]
| This implementation attempts to return all attributes that a real Redis server returns. However, in most cases, the values are set to 0, because they cannot be retrieved or don't make any sense in {{brandname}}.

| link:https://redis.io/commands/info[LLEN]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/info[LINDEX]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/memory-info[MEMORY-USAGE]
| This command will return the memory used by the key and the value. It doesn't include the memory used by additional metadata associated with the entry.

| link:https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats[MEMORY-STATS]
| This command will return the same fields as a real Redis server, but all values will be set to 0.

| link:https://redis.io/commands/mget[MGET]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/mset[MSET]
|

| link:https://redis.io/commands/linsert[LINSERT]
| Current implementation time complexity is O(N), where N is the size of the list.

| link:https://redis.io/commands/lmove[LMOVE]
| Current implementation is atomic for rotation (source and destination are the same list). For different lists there is relaxed consistency
for concurrent operations or failures unless the resp cache is configured to used transactions.
