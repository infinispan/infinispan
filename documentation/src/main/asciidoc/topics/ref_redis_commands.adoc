[NOTE]
=====
 JSON filter with RegEx differencies from Redis implementation:

1. Pattern could be expressed in Redis style "(i)pattern" or Java style "/.*pattern.*/i)".
2. Dynamic filter with regex is not supported. i.e. `$.store.book[?(@.name =~ $.pattern)]` doesn't work.
3. Filtering an array returns all matching elements and all nested arrays containing matching elements.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/lcs[LCS]

* link:https://redis.io/commands/lmove[LMOVE]
+
NOTE: The current implementation is atomic for rotation when the source and destination are the same list. For different lists, there is relaxed consistency for concurrent operations or failures unless the resp cache is configured to use transactions.

NOTE: This command will return the memory used by the key and the value. It doesn't include the memory used by additional metadata associated with the entry.

* link:https://redis.io/commands/memory-stats[MEMORY STATS]
+
NOTE: This command will return the same fields as a real Redis server, but all values will be set to `0`.

NOTE: The current implementation has a relaxed isolation level. A client can see the source and destination set without
the element. The operation is not atomic, it could remove the element from source and fails to insert to the target set.
