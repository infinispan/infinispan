= Command-Line Interface cache loader
The Command-Line Interface (CLI) cache loader is a cache loader implementation
that retrieves data from another {brandname} node using the CLI. The node to
which the CLI connects to could be a standalone node, or could be a node that
it's part of a cluster. This cache loader is read-only, so it will only be
used to retrieve data, and hence, won't be used when persisting data.

== CLI Cache Loader
The CLI cache loader is configured with a connection URL pointing to the
{brandname} node to which connect to. Here is an example:

//Exclude segmentation from productized docs.

[NOTE]
====
The Command-Line Interface (CLI) cache loader does not support segmentation.
