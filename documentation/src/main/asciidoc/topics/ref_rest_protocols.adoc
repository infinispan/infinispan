= Supported Protocols

The REST Server supports `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` protocols.

You can switch to `HTTP/2` with either of the following:

* performing an link:https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#discover-http[HTTP/1.1 upgrade procedure].
* negotiating the communication protocol using an link:https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#versioning[TLS/ALPN extension].

[NOTE]
====
TLS/ALPN with JDK8 requires additional client configuration. Refer to the
appropriate documentation for your REST client but you are likely to need Jetty
ALPN Agent or OpenSSL bindings.
