[id='expiration-{context}']
= Expiration
Expiration removes entries from caches when they reach one of the following
time limits:

Lifespan::
Sets the maximum amount of time that entries can exist.

Maximum idle::
Specifies how long entries can remain idle. If operations do not occur for
entries, they become idle.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Maximum idle expiration does not currently support:

* Entries stored in off-heap memory.
* Cache configurations with persistent cache stores.

When using expiration with an exception-based eviction policy, entries that are
expired but not yet removed from the cache count towards the size of the data
container.
