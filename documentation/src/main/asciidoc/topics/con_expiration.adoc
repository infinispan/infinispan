[id='expiration_{context}']
= Expiration with lifespan and maximum idle

Expiration configures {brandname} to remove entries from caches when they reach one of the following time limits:

Lifespan::
Sets the maximum amount of time that entries can exist.

Maximum idle::
Specifies how long entries can remain idle. If operations do not occur for
entries, they become idle.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Maximum idle expiration does not currently support caches with persistent storage.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you use expiration and eviction with the `EXCEPTION` eviction strategy, entries that are expired, but not yet removed from the cache, count towards the size of the data container.
