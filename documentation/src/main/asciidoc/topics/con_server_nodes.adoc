= Server nodes
Each "Server" in the above diagram represents an actual {brandname} Server node.
The server runs in a separate JVM process from the Host Controller.
The Host Controller is responsible for launching that process.
In a managed domain the end user cannot directly launch a server process from the command line.

The Host Controller synthesizes the server's configuration by combining elements from the domain wide configuration (from +domain.xml+) and the host-specific configuration (from +host.xml+).

== Example configurations
The server distribution also provides a set of example configuration files in the docs/examples/configs (mostly using standalone mode) which illustrate a variety of possible configurations and use-cases.
To use them, just copy them to the standalone/configuration directory and start the server using the following syntax:

 bin/standalone.sh -c configuration_file_name.xml
