= Backup Strategies
{brandname} clusters can use different strategies for backing up data to remote sites.

{brandname} replicates across sites at the same time that writes to local caches occur. For example, if a client writes "k1" to **LON**, {brandname} backs up "k1" to **NYC** at the same time.
