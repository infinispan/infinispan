= Transactions with persistent cache stores
{brandname} supports transactional operations with JDBC-based cache stores only.
To configure caches as transactional, you set `transactional=true` to keep data in persistent storage synchronized with data in memory.

For all other cache stores, {brandname} does not enlist cache loaders in transactional operations.
This can result in data inconsistency if transactions succeed in modifying data in memory but do not completely apply changes to data in the cache store.
In these cases manual recovery is not possible with cache stores.
