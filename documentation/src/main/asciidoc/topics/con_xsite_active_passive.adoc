= Client connections across sites
Clients can write to {brandname} clusters in either an Active/Passive or
Active/Active configuration.

[discrete]
== Active/Passive

The following diagram illustrates Active/Passive where {brandname} handles
client requests from one site only:

image::xsite-active-passive.svg[]

In the preceding image:

. Client connects to the {brandname} cluster at **LON**.
. Client writes "k1" to the cache.
. The relay node at **LON**, "n1", sends the request to replicate "k1" to the relay node at **NYC**, "nA".

With Active/Passive, **NYC** provides data redundancy. If the {brandname}
cluster at **LON** goes offline for any reason, clients can start sending
requests to **NYC**. When you bring **LON** back online you can synchronize
data with **NYC** and then switch clients back to **LON**.

[discrete]
== Active/Active

The following diagram illustrates Active/Active where {brandname} handles
client requests at two sites:

image::xsite-active-active.svg[]

In the preceding image:

. Client A connects to the {brandname} cluster at **LON**.
. Client A writes "k1" to the cache.
. Client B connects to the {brandname} cluster at **NYC**.
. Client B writes "k2" to the cache.
. Relay nodes at **LON** and **NYC** send requests so that "k1" is replicated to **NYC** and "k2" is replicated to **LON**.

With Active/Active both **NYC** and **LON** replicate data to remote caches
while handling client requests. If either **NYC** or **LON** go offline,
clients can start sending requests to the online site. You can then bring
offline sites back online, push state to synchronize data, and switch clients
as required.

== Backup strategies and client connections

[IMPORTANT]
====
An asynchronous backup strategy (`strategy=async`) is recommended with Active/Active configurations.
====

If multiple clients attempt to write to the same entry concurrently, and the backup strategy is synchronous (`strategy=sync`), then deadlocks occur.
However you can use the synchronous backup strategy with an Active/Passive configuration if both sites access different data sets, in which case there is no risk of deadlocks from concurrent writes.
