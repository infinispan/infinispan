[id='local-security-realms_{context}']
= Local security realms

A local security realm allows the CLI to authenticate against the local {brandname} instance without prompting the user
for a username and password. This mechanism only works if the user running the CLI has read access to the server's
temporary directory. This realm should always be used together with another realm, such as a `properties` realm.
If the local mechanism fails then the CLI will fall back to prompting for a username and password
for a user configured as in Default HTTP Interface Security.
When authenticating with this realm, the user will have all permissions.
