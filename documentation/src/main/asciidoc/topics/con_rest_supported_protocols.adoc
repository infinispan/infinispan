[[rest_supported_protocols]]
= Supported protocols

The REST Server supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. It is possible to switch to HTTP/2 by either performing a link:https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#discover-http[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade procedure] or
by negotiating communication protocols using link:https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#versioning[TLS/ALPN extension].

[NOTE]
====
TLS/ALPN with JDK8 requires additional steps from the client perspective. Please refer to your client documentation. It is very likely
that you will need Jetty ALPN Agent or OpenSSL bindings.
