= User Roles and Permissions
{brandname} includes a default set of roles that grant users with permissions to access data and interact with {brandname} resources.

`ClusterRoleMapper` is the default mechanism that {brandname} uses to associate security principals to authorization roles.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`ClusterRoleMapper` matches principal names to role names.
A user named `admin` gets `admin` permissions automatically, a user named `deployer` gets `deployer` permissions, and so on.
