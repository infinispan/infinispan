= Cache template inheritance

Cache configuration templates can inherit from other templates to extend and override settings.

Cache template inheritance is hierarchical.
For a child configuration template to inherit from a parent, you must include it after the parent template.

Additionally, template inheritance is additive for elements that have multiple values.
A cache that inherits from another template merges the values from that template, which can override properties.
