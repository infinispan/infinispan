= Asynchronous Communications
All clustered cache modes can be configured to use asynchronous communications with the
link:{configdocroot}[`mode="ASYNC"`]
attribute on the `<replicated-cache/>`, `<distributed-cache>`, or `<invalidation-cache/>`
element.

With asynchronous communications, the originator node does not receive any
acknowledgement from the other nodes about the status of the operation, so there is no
way to check if it succeeded on other nodes.

We do not recommend asynchronous communications in general, as they can cause
inconsistencies in the data, and the results are hard to reason about.
Nevertheless, sometimes speed is more important than consistency, and the option is
available for those cases.
