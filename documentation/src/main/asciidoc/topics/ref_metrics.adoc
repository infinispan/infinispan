= {brandname} Metrics
{brandname} is compatible with the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics API and can
generate gauge and histogram metrics.

* {brandname} metrics are provided at the `vendor` scope. Metrics related to
the JVM are provided in the `base` scope for {brandname} server.
* Gauges provide values such as the average number of nanoseconds for write
operations or JVM uptime. Gauges are enabled by default. If you enable
statistics, {brandname} automatically generates gauges.
* Histograms provide details about operation execution times such as read,
write, and remove times. {brandname} does not enable histograms by default
because they require additional computation.
