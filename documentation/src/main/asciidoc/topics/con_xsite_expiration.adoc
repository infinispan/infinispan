= Expiration and Cross-Site Replication
{brandname} expiration controls how long entries remain in the cache.

* `lifespan` expiration is suitable for cross-site replication. When entries reach the maximum lifespan, {brandname} expires them independently of the remote sites.

* `max-idle` expiration does not work with cross-site replication. {brandname} cannot determine when cache entries reach the idle timeout in remote sites.
