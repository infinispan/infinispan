= Segmented cache stores
Cache stores can organize data into hash space segments to which keys map. Stores are segmented by default.

Segmented stores increase read performance for bulk operations; for example,
streaming over data (`Cache.size`, `Cache.entrySet.stream`), pre-loading the
cache, and doing state transfer operations.



[IMPORTANT]
====


If you change the `numSegments` parameter in the configuration after you add a
segmented cache store, {brandname} cannot read data from that cache store.
