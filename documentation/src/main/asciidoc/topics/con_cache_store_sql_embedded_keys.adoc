= Embedded keys

Protobuf schema can include keys within values, as in the following example:

.Protobuf schema with an embedded key
[source,protobuf,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::protobuf/books_embedded_keys.protobuf[]
----

To use embedded keys, you must include the `embedded-key="true"` attribute or `embeddedKey(true)` method in your SQL store configuration.
