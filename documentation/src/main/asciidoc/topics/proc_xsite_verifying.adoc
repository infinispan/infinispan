= Verifying cross-site views

When you set up {brandname} to perform cross-site replication, you should check log files to ensure that {brandname} clusters have successfully formed cross-site views.

.Procedure

. Open {brandname} log files with any appropriate editor.
. Check for `ISPN000439: Received new x-site view` messages.

For example, if a {brandname} cluster in **LON** has formed a cross-site view with a {brandname} cluster in **NYC**, logs include the following messages:

----
INFO  [org.infinispan.XSITE] (jgroups-5,<server-hostname>) ISPN000439: Received new x-site view: [NYC]
INFO  [org.infinispan.XSITE] (jgroups-7,<server-hostname>) ISPN000439: Received new x-site view: [LON, NYC]
----
