= Verifying Cross-Site Views
After you configure {brandname} for cross-site replication, you should verify
that {brandname} clusters successfully form cross-site views.

.Procedure

* Check log messages for `ISPN000439: Received new x-site view` messages.

For example, if the {brandname} cluster in **LON** has formed a cross-site view
with the {brandname} cluster in **NYC**, it provides the following messages:

----
INFO  [org.infinispan.XSITE] (jgroups-5,${server.hostname}) ISPN000439: Received new x-site view: [NYC]
INFO  [org.infinispan.XSITE] (jgroups-7,${server.hostname}) ISPN000439: Received new x-site view: [NYC, LON]
----
