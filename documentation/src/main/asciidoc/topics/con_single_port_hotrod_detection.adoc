= Hot Rod Protocol Detection
The single-port router has built-in automatic detection of Hot Rod messages which trigger a transparent "upgrade" to the
Hot Rod protocol. This means that no changes are required on the client side to connect to a single-port endpoint.
It also means that older clients will also be able to function seamlessly.
