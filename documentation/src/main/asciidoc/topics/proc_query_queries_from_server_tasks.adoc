= Remote queries from server tasks

Indexes for remote caches encoded with ProtoBuf can be used to run queries from server tasks,
even if the server tasks are run embedded with the server JVM.

Here is an example:

.Run remote queries from a server task
[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/RemoteQueryAccessTask.java[]
----

The `RemoteQueryAccess` can be obtained from the `TaskContext`.

It allows run the remote queries.

Using the method `executeQuery`, that will take the following parameter:

. `queryString`: the Iclke query to execute, as it was executed from a client
. `namedParametersMap`: the parameters to pass to the query
. `offset` and `maxResults`: for pagination
. `hitCountAccuracy`: the bound up to hit count will be exact
. `local`: if the query should report results only considering the local index shard
