= Index Annotations
When you enable indexing in {brandname} caches, you use the following annotations:

* `@Indexed` denotes a Java object that you want to index.
* `@Field` controls how fields within objects are indexed.

For {brandname} as an embedded library, you add these annotations your Java classes.

For {brandname} Server, you define Protobuf schemas, `.proto` files, that contain these annotations.
