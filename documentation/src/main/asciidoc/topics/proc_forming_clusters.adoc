= Verifying cluster views
{brandname} Server instances on the same network automatically discover each other and form clusters.

Complete this procedure to observe cluster discovery with the `MPING` protocol in the default `TCP` stack with locally running {brandname} Server instances.
If you want to adjust cluster transport for custom network requirements, see the documentation for setting up {brandname} clusters.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is intended to demonstrate the principle of cluster discovery and is not intended for production environments.
Doing things like specifying a port offset on the command line is not a reliable way to configure cluster transport for production.

.Prerequisites

Have one instance of {brandname} Server running.

.Procedure

. Open a terminal in `{server_home}`.
. Copy the root directory to `server2`.

.Verification

You can view cluster membership in the console at link:http://127.0.0.1:11222/console/cluster-membership[`127.0.0.1:11222/console/cluster-membership`].

{brandname} also logs the following messages when nodes join clusters:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
INFO  [org.infinispan.CLUSTER] (jgroups-11,<server_hostname>)
ISPN000094: Received new cluster view for channel cluster:
[<server_hostname>|3] (2) [<server_hostname>, <server2_hostname>]

INFO  [org.infinispan.CLUSTER] (jgroups-11,<server_hostname>)
ISPN100000: Node <server2_hostname> joined the cluster
