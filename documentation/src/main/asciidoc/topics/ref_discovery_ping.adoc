= PING
PING, or UDPPING is a generic JGroups discovery mechanism that uses dynamic multicasting with the UDP protocol.

When joining, nodes send PING requests to an IP multicast address to discover other nodes already in the {brandname} cluster.
Each node responds to the PING request with a packet that contains the address of the coordinator node and its own address. C=coordinatorâ€™s address and A=own address.
If no nodes respond to the PING request, the joining node becomes the coordinator node in a new cluster.
