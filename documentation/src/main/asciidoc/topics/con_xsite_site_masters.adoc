= Site Masters
Site masters are the nodes in {brandname} clusters that are responsible for
sending and receiving requests from backup locations.

If a node is not a site master, it must forward backup requests to a local site
master. Only site masters can send requests to backup locations.

For optimal performance, you should configure all nodes as site masters. This
increases the speed of backup requests because each node in the cluster can
backup to remote sites directly without having to forward backup requests to
site masters.
