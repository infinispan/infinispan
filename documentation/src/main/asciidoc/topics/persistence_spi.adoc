= SPI

The following class diagram presents the main SPI interfaces of the persistence API:

Some notes about the classes:

* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/io/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer] - abstracts the serialized form of an object

* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/MarshalledEntry.html[MarshalledEntry] - abstracts the information held within
  a persistent store corresponding to a key-value added to the cache. Provides method for reading this information both in serialized (link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/commons/io/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]) and deserialized (Object) format. Normally data read from the store is kept in serialized format and lazily deserialized on demand, within the
  link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/MarshalledEntry.html[MarshalledEntry] implementation

* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheWriter.html[CacheWriter] and link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/CacheLoader.html[CacheLoader] provide basic methods for reading and writing to a store

* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.html[AdvancedCacheLoader] and link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.html[AdvancedCacheWriter] provide operations to manipulate the underlaying storage in bulk: parallel iteration and purging of expired entries, clear and size.

//Exclude segmented cache stores from productized docs.
ifndef::productized[]
* link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/SegmentedAdvancedLoadWriteStore.html[SegmentedAdvancedLoadWriteStore] provide all the various operations that deal with segments.

A cache store can be segmented if it does one of the following:

* Implements the
link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/SegmentedAdvancedLoadWriteStore.html[SegmentedAdvancedLoadWriteStore] interface. In this case only a single
store instance is used per cache.

* Has a configuration that extends the link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/configuration/cache/AbstractSegmentedConfiguration.html[AbstractSegmentedConfiguration] abstract class. Doing this requires you to implement the `newConfigurationFrom` method where it is expected
that a new `StoreConfiguration` instance is created per invocation. This
creates a store instance per segment to which a node can write. Stores might
start and stop as data is moved between nodes.
endif::productized[]

A provider might choose to only implement a subset of these interfaces:

* Not implementing the  link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheWriter.html[AdvancedCacheWriter] makes the given writer not usable for purging expired entries or clear

* If a loader does not implement the link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/persistence/spi/AdvancedCacheLoader.html[AdvancedCacheLoader]
inteface, then it will not participate in preloading nor in cache iteration
(required also for stream operations).

If you're looking at migrating your existing store to the new API or to write a new store implementation, the link:https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/infinispan/persistence/file/SingleFileStore.java[SingleFileStore] might be a good starting point/example.
