= Setting up target {brandname} clusters

Create a cluster that uses the {brandname} version to which you plan to upgrade and then connect the source cluster to the target cluster using a remote cache store.

.Prerequisites

* Install {brandname} Server nodes with the desired version for your target cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure the network properties for the target cluster do not overlap with those
for the source cluster.
You should specify unique names for the target and source clusters in the JGroups transport configuration.
Depending on your environment you can also use different network interfaces and port offsets to separate the target and source clusters.
====

.Procedure

. Create a remote cache store configuration, in JSON format, that allows the target cluster to connect to the source cluster.
+
Remote cache stores on the target cluster use the Hot Rod protocol to retrieve data from the source cluster.
+
[source,json,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::json/remote_store_minimal.json[]
----
+
. Use the {brandname} Command Line Interface (CLI) or REST API to add the remote cache store configuration to the target cluster so it can connect to the source cluster.
+
* CLI: Use the [command]`migrate cluster connect` command on the target cluster.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
[//containers/default]> migrate cluster connect -c myCache --file=remote-store.json
----
+
* REST API: Invoke a POST request that includes the remote store configuration in the payload with the `rolling-upgrade/source-connection` method.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
POST /v2/caches/myCache/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----
+
. Repeat the preceding step for each cache that you want to migrate.
. Switch clients over to the target cluster, so it starts handling all requests.
.. Update client configuration with the location of the target cluster.
.. Restart clients.
