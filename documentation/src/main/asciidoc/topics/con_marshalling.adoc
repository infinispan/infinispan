= Marshalling
Marshalling is a process that converts Java objects into a binary format that can be transferred across the network or stored to disk.
The reverse process, unmarshalling, transforms data from a binary format back into Java objects.

{brandname} performs marshalling and unmarshalling to:

* Send data to other {brandname} nodes in a cluster.
* Store data in persistent cache stores.
* Transmit objects between clients and remote caches.
* Store objects in off-heap memory.
* Store objects in JVM heap memory when the cache encoding is other than `application/x-java-object`.
