= Cache store migrator
{brandname} provides the `StoreMigrator.java` utility that recreates data for the latest {brandname} cache store implementations.

`StoreMigrator` takes a cache store from a previous version of {brandname} as source and uses a cache store implementation as target.

When you run `StoreMigrator`, it creates the target cache with the cache store type that you define using the `EmbeddedCacheManager` interface.
`StoreMigrator` then loads entries from the source store into memory and then puts them into the target cache.

`StoreMigrator` also lets you migrate data from one type of cache store to another.
For example, you can migrate from a JDBC string-based cache store to a RocksDB cache store.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`StoreMigrator` cannot migrate data from segmented cache stores to:

* Non-segmented cache store.
* Segmented cache stores that have a different number of segments.
