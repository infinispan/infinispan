= Cache store migrator
{brandname} provides the CLI `migrate store` command that recreates data for the latest {brandname} cache store implementations.

The store migrator takes a cache store from a previous version of {brandname} as source and uses a cache store implementation as target.

When you run the store migrator, it creates the target cache with the cache store type that you define using the `EmbeddedCacheManager` interface.
The store migrator then loads entries from the source store into memory and then puts them into the target cache.

The store migrator also lets you migrate data from one type of cache store to another.
For example, you can migrate from a JDBC string-based cache store to a SIFS cache store.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The store migrator cannot migrate data from segmented cache stores to:

* Non-segmented cache store.
* Segmented cache stores that have a different number of segments.
