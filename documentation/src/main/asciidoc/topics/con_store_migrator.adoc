= Cache Store Migrator
{brandname} provides the `StoreMigrator.java` utility that recreates data for
the latest {brandname} cache store implementations.

`StoreMigrator` takes a cache store from a previous version of {brandname} as
source and uses a cache store implementation as target.

When you run `StoreMigrator`, it creates the target cache with the cache store
type that you define using the `EmbeddedCacheManager` interface. `StoreMigrator
then loads entries from the source store into memory and then puts them into
the target cache.

`StoreMigrator` also lets you migrate data from one type of cache store to
another. For example, you can migrate from a JDBC String-Based cache store to a
Single File cache store.
