= Network partition recovery example

This topic illustrates how {brandname} resolves network partitions.

In the following images, there is a {brandname} cluster with four nodes that includes a distributed cache with two replicas for each entry (`owners=2`).
There are four entries in the cache, `k1`, `k2`, `k3` and `k4`.

Using the `DENY_READ_WRITES` strategy, if the cluster splits into two partitions, entries are available for read or write operations only if all replicas of an entry are in the same partition.

When network conditions allow the split nodes to communicate again, {brandname} merges the partitions and restores the cluster.
