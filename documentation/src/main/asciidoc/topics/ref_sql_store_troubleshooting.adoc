ISPN008064: No primary keys found for table <table_name>, check case sensitivity
----

{brandname} logs this message in the following cases:

* The database table does not exist.
* The database table name is case sensitive and needs to be either all lower case or all upper case, depending on the database provider.
* The database table does not have any primary keys defined.

To resolve this issue you should:

. Check your SQL cache store configuration and ensure that you specify the name of an existing table.
. Ensure that the database table name conforms to an case sensitivity requirements.
. Ensure that your database tables have primary keys that uniquely identify the appropriate rows.
