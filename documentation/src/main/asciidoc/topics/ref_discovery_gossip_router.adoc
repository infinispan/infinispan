Gossip routers provide a centralized location on the network from which your
{brandname} cluster can retrieve addresses of other nodes.

You inject the address (`IP:PORT`) of the Gossip router into {brandname} nodes as follows:

. Pass the address as a system property to the JVM; for example, `-DGossipRouterAddress="10.10.2.4[12001]"`.
. Reference that system property in the JGroups configuration file.
