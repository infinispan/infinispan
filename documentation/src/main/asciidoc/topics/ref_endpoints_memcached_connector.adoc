* `name="memcached"` logically names the Memcached connector.
* `socket-binding="memcached"` declares a unique socket binding for the Memcached connector.
* `cache="mycache"` names the cache that the Memcached connector exposes. The default is `memcachedCache`.
+
Memcached connectors expose a single cache only. To expose multiple caches
through the Memcached endpoint, you must declare additional connectors. Each
Memcached connector must also have a unique socket binding.
