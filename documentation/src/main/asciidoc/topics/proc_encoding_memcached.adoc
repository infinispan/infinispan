= Configuring cache encoding for Memcached clients
{brandname} Server disables the Memcached endpoint by default.
If you enable the Memcached endpoint, you should configure your Memcached cache with a suitable encoding.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Memcached endpoint does not support authentication. For security purposes
you should use dedicated caches for Memcached clients. You should not use REST
or Hot Rod clients to interact on the same data set as Memcached clients.
====

.Procedure

. Configure cache encoding for keys and values as appropriate.
. Specify any appropriate media type for values.

.Encoding

The Memcached endpoint includes a `client-encoding` attribute that converts the
encoding of values.

For example, as in the preceding configuration example, you store values
encoded as Protobuf. If you want Memcached clients to read and write values as
JSON, you can use the following configuration:
