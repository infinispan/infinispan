= Containers
The {brandname} subsystem can declare multiple containers. A container is declared as follows:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/ispn_subsystem_containers.xml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} does not provide an implicit default cache, but lets you name a cache as the default.
====

If you need to declare clustered caches (distributed, replicated, invalidation), you also need to specify the `<transport/>` element which references an existing JGroups transport. This is not needed if you only intend to have local caches only.
