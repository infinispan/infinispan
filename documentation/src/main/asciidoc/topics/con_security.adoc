= {brandname} Security
{brandname} provides security for components as well as data across different layers:

* Within the core library to provide role-based access control (RBAC) to CacheManagers, Cache instances, and stored data.
* Over remote protocols to authenticate client requests and encrypt network traffic.
* Across nodes in clusters to authenticate new cluster members and encrypt the cluster transport.

The {brandname} core library uses standard Java security libraries such as
JAAS, JSSE, JCA, JCE, and SASL to ease integration and improve compatibility 
with custom applications and container environments. For this reason, the
{brandname} core library provides only interfaces and a set of basic
implementations.

{brandname} servers support a wide range of security standards and mechanisms
to readily integrate with enterprise-level security frameworks.
