= Multi-tenancy with REST

Multi-tenancy router uses URL prefixes to separate containers using the following template: `https://<server_ip>:<server_port>/rest/<rest_connector_name>/<cache_name>/<key>`. All HTTP operations remain exactly the same as using standard `rest-connector`.

The REST connector by default support both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. The switching from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 procedure involves
either using TLS/ALPN negotiation or HTTP/1.1 upgrade procedure. The former requires proper encryption to be enabled. The latter
is always enabled.
