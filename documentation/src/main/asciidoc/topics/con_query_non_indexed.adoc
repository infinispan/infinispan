= Non-indexed queries

{brandname} recommends indexing caches for the best performance for queries.
However you can query caches that are non-indexed.

* For embedded caches, you can perform non-indexed queries on Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
* For remote caches, you must use ProtoStream encoding with the `application/x-protostream` media type to perform non-indexed queries.
