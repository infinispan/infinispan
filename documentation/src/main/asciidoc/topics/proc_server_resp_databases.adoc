= Mapping caches to Redis logical databases

Use the cache `aliases` configuration attributes to map caches to Redis logical databases.
The default `respCache` is mapped to logical database `0`.

[TIP]
====
{brandname} can use multiple logical databases even in clustered mode, as opposed to Redis which only supports database
`0` when using Redis Cluster.
