[id='cache-template-xinclude_{context}']
= Multiple cache templates from file

Split cache configuration templates into multiple files for granular flexibility and reference them with XML inclusions (XInclude).

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} provides minimal support for the XInclude specification.
This means you cannot use the `xpointer` attribute, the `xi:fallback` element, text processing, or content negotiation.

You must also add the `xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"` namespace to `infinispan.xml` to use XInclude.

{brandname} also provides an `infinispan-config-fragment-{schemaversion}.xsd` schema that you can use with configuration fragments.
