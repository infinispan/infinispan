= Supported Types
{brandname} uses a ProtoStream API to encode and decode Java objects into
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf); a language-neutral, backwards compatible format.

ProtoStream can handle the following types for keys and values, as well as the
unboxed equivalents in the case of primitive types:

* `byte[]`
* `Byte`
* `String`
* `Integer`
* `Long`
* `Double`
* `Float`
* `Boolean`
* `Short`
* `Character`
* `java.util.Date`
* `java.time.Instant`
