= ProtoStream Types
ProtoStream can handle the following types, as well as the unboxed equivalents
in the case of primitive types, without any additional configuration:

* `String`
* `Integer`
* `Long`
* `Double`
* `Float`
* `Boolean`
* `byte[]`
* `Byte`
* `Short`
* `Character`
* `java.util.Date`
* `java.time.Instant`

To marshall any other Java objects, you must generate, or manually create,
`SerializationContextInitializer` implementations that register `.proto`
schemas and marshallers with a `SerializationContext`.
