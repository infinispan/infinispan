= Cache Authorization
{brandname} can restrict access to data by authorizing requests to perform
cache operations.

{brandname} maps identities, or Principals of type `java.security.Principal`,
to security roles in your configuration. For example, a Principal named
`reader` maps to a security role named `reader`.

{brandname} lets you assign permissions to the various roles to authorize cache
operations. For example, `Cache.get()` requires read permission while
`Cache.put()` requires write permission.

In this case, iff a client with the `reader` role attempts to write an entry,
{brandname} denies the request and throws a security exception. However, if a
client with the `writer` role sends a write request, {brandname} validates
authorization and issues the client with a token for subsequent operations.
