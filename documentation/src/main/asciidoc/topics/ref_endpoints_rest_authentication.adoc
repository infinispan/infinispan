|===
| Authentication mechanism | Description | Related details

| `BASIC`
| Uses credentials in plain-text format. You should use `BASIC` authentication with encrypted connections only.
| Corresponds to the `Basic` HTTP authentication scheme and is similar to the `PLAIN` SASL mechanism.

| `DIGEST`
| Uses hashing algorithms and nonce values. REST connectors support `SHA-512`, `SHA-256` and `MD5` hashing algorithms.
| Corresponds to the `Digest` HTTP authentication scheme and is similar to `+DIGEST-*+` SASL mechanisms.

| `SPNEGO`
| Uses Kerberos tickets and requires a Kerberos Domain Controller. You must add a corresponding `kerberos` server identity in the realm configuration. In most cases, you also specify an `ldap-realm` to provide user membership information.
| Corresponds to the `Negotiate` HTTP authentication scheme and is similar to the `GSSAPI` and `GS2-KRB5` SASL mechanisms.

| `BEARER_TOKEN`
| Uses OAuth tokens and requires a `token-realm` configuration.
| Corresponds to the `Bearer` HTTP authentication scheme and is similar to `OAUTHBEARER` SASL mechanism.

| `CLIENT_CERT`
| Uses client certificates.
| Similar to the `EXTERNAL` SASL mechanism.
