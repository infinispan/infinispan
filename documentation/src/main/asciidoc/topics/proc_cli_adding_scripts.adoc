= Adding Scripts to {brandname} Servers
Use the command line interface to add scripts to {brandname} servers.

.Prerequisites

{brandname} Server stores scripts in the `\___script_cache` cache. If you enable cache authorization, users must have `CREATE` permissions to add to `___script_cache`.

Assign users the `deployer` role at minimum if you use default authorization settings.

.Procedure

. Define scripts as required.
+
For example, create a file named `multiplication.js` that runs on a single
{brandname} server, has two parameters, and uses JavaScript to multiply a given
value:
+
[source,javascript]
----
// mode=local,language=javascript
multiplicand * multiplier
----
+
. Create a CLI connection to {brandname}.
. Use the [command]`task` command to upload scripts, as in the following example:
+
----
[//containers/default]> task upload --file=multiplication.js multiplication
----
+
. Verify that your scripts are available.
+
----
[//containers/default]> ls tasks
multiplication
----
