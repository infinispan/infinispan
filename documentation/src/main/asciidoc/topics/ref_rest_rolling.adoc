= Connecting Source Clusters

Connect a target cluster to the source cluster with:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
POST /v2/caches/{cacheName}/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----

You must provide a `remote-store` definition in JSON format as the body:

.JSON
[source,json,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::xml/remote-store.json[]
----

Several elements are optional such as `security`, `async-executor` and `connection-pool`.
The configuration must contain minimally the cache name, the `raw-values` set to `false` and the
host/ip of the single port in the source cluster. For details about the `remote-store` configuration,
consult the link:https://infinispan.org/schemas/infinispan-cachestore-remote-config-12.0.xsd[XSD Schema].

If the operation successfully completes, the service returns 204 (No Content). If the target cluster is already connected to the source cluster, it returns status 304 (Not Modified).

= Obtaining Source Cluster connection details

To obtain the `remote-store` definition of a cache, use a `GET` request:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
GET /v2/caches/{cacheName}/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----

If the cache was previously connected, it returns the configuration of the associated `remote-store` in JSON format and status 200 (OK),
otherwise a 404 (Not Found) status.


[NOTE]
====
This is not a cluster wide operation, and it only returns the remote-store of the cache in the node where the REST invocation is handled.
====

= Checking if a Cache is connected

To check if a cache have been connected to a remote cluster, use a `HEAD` request:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
HEAD /v2/caches/{cacheName}/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----

Returns status 200 (OK) if for all nodes of the cluster, `cacheName` has a single remote store configured, and 404 (NOT_FOUND) otherwise.

= Synchronizing Data
Synchronize data from a source cluster to a target cluster with `POST` requests
and the `?action=sync-data` parameter:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
POST /v2/caches/{cacheName}?action=sync-data
----

When the operation completes, {brandname} responds with the total number of
entries copied to the target cluster.

[id='rest_v2_disconnect_source']
= Disconnecting Source Clusters
After you synchronize data to target clusters, disconnect from the source
cluster with `DELETE` requests:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
DELETE /v2/caches/{cacheName}/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----

If the operation successfully completes, the service returns `204 (No Content)`.
It no source was connected, it returns code 304 (Not Modified).
