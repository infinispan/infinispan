== Customizing Key Bindings

The CLI uses _GNU Readline_-style configuration.
You can customize key bindings by placing an `inputrc` file in the {brandname} CLI storage directory. If such a file
is not present, the CLI will attempt to load the default `${HOME}/.inputrc` file instead.
The CLI reads this file on startup and applies the configured bindings.
The file uses the GNU Readline `inputrc` format.

For example, to bind `Ctrl-X Ctrl-R` to reverse search:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
"\C-x\C-r": reverse-search-history
----

To set Vi as the default editing mode:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
set editing-mode vi
----
