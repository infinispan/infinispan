= Adding JARs to {brandname} Server installations
You can make custom JAR files available to {brandname} Server by adding them to the classpath.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{brandname} loads JAR files during startup only.
You should bring all nodes in the cluster down gracefully and make any JAR files available to each node before bringing the cluster back up.
====

.Procedure

. Stop {brandname} Server if it is running.
. Add JAR files to the `server/lib` directory, for example:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
├── server
│   └── lib
│       └── UserObjects.jar
