= Creating {brandname} users

Add credentials to authenticate with {brandname} Server deployments through Hot Rod and REST endpoints.
Before you can access the {brandname} Console or perform cache operations you must create at least one user with the {brandname} command line interface (CLI).

[TIP]
====
{brandname} enforces security authorization with role-based access control (RBAC).
Create an `admin` user the first time you add credentials to gain full `ADMIN` permissions to your {brandname} deployment.
====

.Prerequisites

* Download and install {brandname} Server.

.Procedure

. Open a terminal in `{server_home}`.
. Create an `admin` user with the [command]`user create` command.

[NOTE]
====
Adding credentials to a properties realm with the CLI creates the user only on the server instance to which you are connected.
You must manually synchronize credentials in a properties realm to each node in the cluster.
