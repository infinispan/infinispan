= Write-Through
Write-Through is a cache writing mode where writes to memory and writes to
cache stores are synchronous. When a client application updates a cache entry,
in most cases by invoking `Cache.put()`, {brandname} does not return the call
until it updates the cache store. This cache writing mode results in updates to
the cache store concluding within the boundaries of the client thread.

The primary advantage of Write-Through mode is that the cache and cache store
are updated simultaneously, which ensures that the cache store is always
consistent with the cache.

However, Write-Through mode can potentially decrease performance because the
need to access and update cache stores directly adds latency to cache
operations.

{brandname} defaults to Write-Through mode unless you explicitly configure
Write-Behind mode on cache stores.
