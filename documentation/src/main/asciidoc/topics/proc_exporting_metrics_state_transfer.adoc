= Exporting metrics during a state transfer operation

You can export time metrics for clustered caches that {brandname} redistributes across nodes. 

A state transfer operation occurs when a clustered cache topology changes, such as a node joining or leaving a cluster.
During a state transfer operation, {brandname} exports metrics from each cache, so that you can determine a cache's status.
A state transfer exposes attributes as properties, so that {brandname} can export metrics from each cache.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot perform a state transfer operation in invalidation mode. 
====

{brandname} generates time metrics that are compatible with the REST API and the JMX API. 

.Prerequisites
* Configure {brandname} metrics.
* Enable metrics for your cache type, such as embedded cache or remote cache.
* Initiate a state transfer operation by changing your clustered cache topology. 


.Procedure
* Choose one of the following methods:
** Configure {brandname} to use the REST API to collect metrics.
** Configure {brandname} to use the JMX API to collect metrics.
