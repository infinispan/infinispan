== Configuring {brandname} as the Spring Cache Provider
The Spring cache provider SPI has two interfaces through which it interacts with {brandname}: `org.springframework.cache.CacheManager` and `org.springframework.cache.Cache`.
The `CacheManager` interface acts as a factory for named `Cache` instances.

At runtime Spring looks for a `CacheManager` implementation that has a bean named `cacheManager` in the application context.

.Procedure

* Configure {brandname} with the `cacheManager` bean in one of the following ways:

.Declarative
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+,role="primary"]
----
include::config_examples/spring_cache_manager_bean.xml[]
----
.Programmatic
[source,java,options=nowrap,subs=attributes+,role="secondary"]
----
include::code_examples/SpringCacheManager.java[]
