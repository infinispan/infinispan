= Adding the ProtoStream processor

{brandname} provides a ProtoStream processor artifact that processes Java annotations in your classes at compile time to generate Protobuf schemas, accompanying marshallers, and a concrete implementation of the `SerializationContextInitializer` interface.

.Procedure

* Add the `protostream-processor` dependency to your `pom.xml` with the `provided` scope.
+
[NOTE]
====
This dependency is required at compile-time only so you should use the `provided` scope or mark it as optional.
You should also ensure the `protostream-processor` is not propagated as a transitive dependency.
