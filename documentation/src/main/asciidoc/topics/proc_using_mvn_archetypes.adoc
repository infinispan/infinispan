= Generating projects from Maven archetypes

{brandname} provides a set of Maven archetypes that you can use to generate
skeleton projects with sample code and `pom.xml` files. You can then import
these projects into your IDE and start building and running applications with
{brandname} capabilities.

.Prerequisites

* Maven 3.2 or later.
//Community content
ifdef::community[]
* Configure Maven settings to include the link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.infinispan.archetypes[`org.infinispan.archetypes`] artifacts.
endif::community[]
//Downstream content
ifdef::downstream[]
* Ensure the {RedHat} GA repository, `redhat-ga-repository`, is included in your Maven settings.
endif::downstream[]

.Procedure

. Open a terminal window in the directory where you want to create project files.
. Generate projects from {brandname} archetypes with the following command:
+
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.infinispan.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=<archetype-name> \ <1>
  -DarchetypeVersion=<infinispan-version> <2>
----
+
<1> Creates projects from one of the following archetypes:
+
* `client` Creates a sample Hot Rod Java client application.
* `embedded` Creates a sample application that embeds {brandname}.
* `store` Creates a sample implementation of a custom cache store.
* `server-task` Creates a sample implementation of a ServerTask.
+
<2> Specifies the {brandname} version to use, for example:
+
`-DarchetypeVersion={ispn_version}`

. When prompted, define _artifactId_, _groupId_, and _version_ values for your project.
. Import your new {brandname} project into your IDE.
. Run your project application from the directory where the `pom.xml` file resides as follows:
+
----
mvn package exec:java
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `store` and `server-task` archetype does not include a project application,
`Application.java`, that you can run.
