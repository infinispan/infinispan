= Single-Port router

Internally, Single-Port is based on the same router component used to enable multi-tenancy, and therefore it shares the same configuration.

With the configuration above, the Single-Port Router will operate on `rest` and `rest-ssl` socket
bindings. The router named `router` should typically operate on port `8080` and will use HTTP/1.1 Upgrade
(also known as _cleartext upgrade_) procedure. The other router instance (called `router-ssl`) should typically
operate on port `8443` and will use TLS/ALPN.
