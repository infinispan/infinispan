= Setting Up Target Clusters
Create a cluster that runs the target {brandname} version.

.Prerequisites

* Install a {brandname} cluster with the target upgrade version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure the network properties for the target cluster do not overlap with those
for the source cluster. You should specify unique names for the target and
source clusters in the JGroups transport configuration. Depending on your
environment you can also use different network interfaces and specify port
offsets to keep the target and source clusters separate.
====

.Procedure

. Connect the target cluster to the source cluster for each cache you want
to migrate from the source cluster.
+
. Switch clients over to the target cluster, so it starts handling all requests.
.. Update client configuration with the location of the target cluster.
.. Restart clients.
