= Configuring Hot Rod Client Encryption
{brandname} Server can enforce SSL/TLS encryption and present Hot Rod clients with certificates to establish trust and negotiate secure connections.

To verify server-issued certificates, Hot Rod clients require part of the TLS
certificate chain.
For example, the following image shows a certificate authority (CA), named "CA", that has issued a certificate for a server instance named "HotRodServer":

.Procedure

. Create a Java keystore with part of the server certificate chain. In most cases you should use the public certificate for the CA.
. Specify the keystore as a _TrustStore_ in the client configuration with the `SslConfigurationBuilder` class.
