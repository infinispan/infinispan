== Connection pool tuning properties

You can tune connection pools with the following parameters:

[%autowidth,cols="1,1",stripes=even]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`initial-size`
|Initial number of connections the pool should hold.

|`max-size`
|Maximum number of connections in the pool.

|`min-size`
|Minimum number of connections the pool should hold.

|`blocking-timeout`
|Maximum time in milliseconds to block while waiting for a connection before throwing an exception.
This will never throw an exception if creating a new connection takes an inordinately long period of time.
Default is `0` meaning that a call will wait indefinitely.

|`background-validation`
|Time in milliseconds between background validation runs. A duration of `0` means that this feature is disabled.

|`validate-on-acquisition`
|Connections idle for longer than this time, specified in milliseconds, are validated before being acquired (foreground validation). A duration of `0` means that this feature is disabled.

|`idle-removal`
|Time in minutes a connection has to be idle before it can be removed.

|`leak-detection`
|Time in milliseconds a connection has to be held before a leak warning.
