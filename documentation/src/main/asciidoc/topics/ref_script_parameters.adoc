= Script Parameters
Aside from the standard bindings described above, when a script is executed it can be passed a set of named parameters which also appear as bindings.
Parameters are passed as +name,value+ pairs where +name+ is a string and +value+ can be any value that is understood by the marshaller in use.

The following is an example of a JavaScript script which takes two parameters, +multiplicand+ and +multiplier+ and multiplies them.
Because the last operation is an expression evaluation, its result is returned to the invoker.
