= Setting the Cache Size

Setting the cache size configures the limit at which {brandname} begins eviction.

[TIP]
====
Try different cache sizes to find optimal performance. If the cache size is to large, you can run out of memory. If it is too small, available memory is wasted.
====

Do one of the following:

* For `COUNT`, set the maximum number of entries the cache can hold.
* For `MEMORY`, set the maximum number of bytes the cache can take from memory.

Declaratively::
Use the `size` attribute for the storage type.
Programmatically::
Use the `size()` method.
