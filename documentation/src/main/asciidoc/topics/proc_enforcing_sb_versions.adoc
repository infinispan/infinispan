.Procedure

* Add `infinispan-bom` to your `pom.xml` file before the starter dependencies.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {brandname} Spring Boot starter uses different Spring Boot versions to other projects such as Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes. If you want to use a specific Spring Boot version for compatibility with other projects, you must add the correct dependency to your project.
