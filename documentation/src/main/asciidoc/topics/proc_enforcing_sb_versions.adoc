= Enforcing {brandname} Versions

This starter uses a high-level API to ensure compatibility between major versions of {brandname}. However you can enforce a specific version of {brandname} with the `infinispan-bom` module.

Add `infinispan-bom` to your `pom.xml` file before the starter dependencies, as follows:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::dependencies_maven/sb_bom.xml[]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {brandname} Spring Boot starter uses different Spring Boot versions to other projects such as Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes. If you want to use a specific Spring Boot version for compatibility with other projects, you must add the correct dependency to your project.
