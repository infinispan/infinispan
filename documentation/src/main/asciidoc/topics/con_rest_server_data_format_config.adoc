Each cache exposed via REST stores data in a configurable data format defined by a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[Media Type]. There are more details in the configuration link:#encoding_media_type[here].

An example of storage configuration is as follows:

* If the cache is indexed, it assumes "application/x-protostream"
