= Hot Rod Server

Use the custom Hot Rod binary protocol to access {brandname}, which allows clients to do dynamic load balancing, failover, and smart routing.

** A link:http://www.infinispan.org/hotrod-clients[variety of clients] exist for this protocol.
** If your clients are running Java, this should be your defacto server module choice because it allows for dynamic load balancing and failover. This means that Hot Rod clients can dynamically detect changes in the topology of Hot Rod servers as long as these are clustered. When new nodes join or leave, clients update their Hot Rod server topology view. Also, when Hot Rod servers are configured with distribution, clients can detect where a particular key resides and can route requests smartly.
** Load balancing and failover are dynamically provided by Hot Rod client implementations using information provided by the server.
