[id='text-encoding_{context}']
= Text-based cache encoding
Text-based encoding is human-readable content such as plain text.
The classic "Hello World" example entry could be stored in a cache as follows:

[source,text,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
key=hello
value=world
----

If you encode caches with the `text/plain` media type, {brandname} can convert to and from the following media types:

* `application/xml`
* `application/json`
* `application/x-protostream`

The following example configuration encodes keys and values with the `text/plain; charset=UTF-8` media type:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::xml/encoding_text_plain.xml[]
----
