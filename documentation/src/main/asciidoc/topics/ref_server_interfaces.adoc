= Server Interfaces
{brandname} servers can use different strategies for binding to IP addresses.

== Address Strategy
Uses an `inet-address` strategy that maps a single `public` interface to the
IPv4 loopback address (`127.0.0.1`).

[TIP]
====
You can use the CLI `-b` argument or the `infinispan.bind.address` property to select a specific address from the
command-line. See link:#changing_bind_address-server[Changing the Default Bind Address].
====

== Loopback Strategy
Selects a loopback address.

* *IPv4* the address block `127.0.0.0/8` is reserved for loopback addresses.
* *IPv6* the address block `::1` is the only loopback address.

----

== Non-Loopback Strategy
Selects a non-loopback address.

== Network Address Strategy
Selects networks based on IP address.

[source,xml]

----

== Any Address Strategy
Selects the `INADDR_ANY` wildcard address. As a result
{brandname} servers listen on all interfaces.

[source,xml]
----
include::config_examples/server_network_anyaddress.xml[]
----

== Link Local Strategy
Selects a _link-local_ IP address.

* *IPv4* the address block `169.254.0.0/16` (`169.254.0.0 â€“ 169.254.255.255`) is reserved for link-local addressing.
* *IPv6* the address block `fe80::/10` is reserved for link-local unicast addressing.

[source,xml]
----
include::config_examples/server_network_inetaddress.xml[]

== Site Local Strategy
Selects a _site-local_ (private) IP address.

* *IPv4* the address blocks `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16` are reserved for site-local addressing.
* *IPv6* the address block `fc00::/7` is reserved for site-local unicast addressing.

== Match Host Strategy
Resolves the host name and selects one of the IP addresses that is assigned to
any network interface.

{brandname} servers enumerate all available operating system interfaces to
locate IP addresses resolved from the host name in your configuration.

== Match Interface Strategy
Selects an IP address assigned to a network interface that matches a regular
expression.

{brandname} servers enumerate all available operating system interfaces to
locate the interface name in your configuration.

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions with this strategy for additional flexibility.

== Match Address Strategy
Similar to `inet-address` but selects an IP address using a regular expression.

{brandname} servers enumerate all available operating system interfaces to
locate the IP address in your configuration.

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions with this strategy for additional flexibility.

== Fallback Strategy
Interface configurations can include multiple strategies. {brandname} servers
try each strategy in the declared order.

For example, with the following configuration, {brandname} servers first
attempt to match a host, then an IP address, and then fall back to the
`INADDR_ANY` wildcard address:
