= Asynchronous Backups
When {brandname} replicates data to backup locations, it does not wait until the
operation completes before writing to the local cache.

Asynchronous backup operations and writes to the local cache are independent of
each other. If backup operations fail, write operations to the local cache
continue and no exceptions occur.
