[id='server-authentication_{context}']
= {brandname} Server authentication

Authentication restricts user access to endpoints as well as the {brandname} Console and Command Line Interface (CLI).

{brandname} Server includes a "default" security realm that enforces user authentication.
Default authentication uses a property realm with user credentials stored in the `server/conf/users.properties` file.
{brandname} Server also enables security authorization by default so you must assign users with permissions stored in the `server/conf/groups.properties` file.

[TIP]
====
Use the [command]`user create` command with the Command Line Interface (CLI) to add users and assign permissions.
Run [command]`user create --help` for examples and more information.
