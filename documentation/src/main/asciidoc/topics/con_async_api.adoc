= Asynchronous API
The Asynchronous API allows you to use synchronous communications,
but without blocking the user thread.

There is one caveat:
The asynchronous operations do NOT preserve the program order.
If a thread calls `cache.putAsync(k, v1); cache.putAsync(k, v2)`, the final value of `k`
may be either `v1` or `v2`.
The advantage over using asynchronous communications is that the final value can't be
`v1` on one node and `v2` on another.
