= Deploying Custom Cache Stores
You can package custom cache stores into JAR files and deploy them to
{brandname} servers as follows:

. Package your custom cache store implementation in a JAR file.
. Add a file under `META-INF/services/` that contains the fully qualified class name of your store implementation.
+
The name of the service file should reflect the interface that your store implements. For example, if your store implements the `AdvancedCacheWriter` interface then you should create the following file:
+
`/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.AdvancedCacheWriter`
+
. Add your JAR file to the `server/lib` directory of your {brandname} server.
