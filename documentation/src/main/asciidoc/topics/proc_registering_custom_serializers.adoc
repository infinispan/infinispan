= Registering Custom Schemas/Serializers
Custom serializers/schemas for the Kryo/Protostuff marshallers must be
registered via their respective service interfaces in order to store deserialized objects.
To achieve this, it is necessary for a *JAR* that contains the service provider to
be registered in the same directory or module as the marshaller bundle and
custom classes.

[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary for the service provider implementation to be provided in
the same *JAR* as the user's custom classes. However, the *JAR* that contains
the provider must be in the same directory/module as the marshaller and custom
class *JAR* files.
