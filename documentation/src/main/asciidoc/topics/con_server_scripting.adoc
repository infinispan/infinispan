= Scripting

Scripting is a feature of {brandname} Server which allows invoking server-side scripts from remote clients.
Scripting leverages the JDK's javax.script ScriptEngines, therefore allowing the use of any JVM languages which offer one.
By default, the JDK comes with Nashorn, a ScriptEngine capable of running JavaScript.
