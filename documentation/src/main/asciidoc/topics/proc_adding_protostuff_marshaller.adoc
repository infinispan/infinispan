= Protostuff

Add the protostuff marshaller dependency to your pom:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::dependencies_maven/protostuff_marshaller.xml[]
----

To register custom Protostuff schemas in your own code, you must register the custom schema with Protostuff before any
marshalling begins. This can be achieved by simply calling:

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/RegisterCustomProtostuffSchema.java[]
----

Or, you can implement a service provider for the `SchemaRegistryService.java` interface, placing all Schema registrations
in the `register()` method.  Implementations of this interface are loaded via Java's ServiceLoader api, therefore the full path
of the implementing class(es) should be provided in a `META-INF/services/org/infinispan/marshaller/protostuff/SchemaRegistryService`
file within your deployment jar.
