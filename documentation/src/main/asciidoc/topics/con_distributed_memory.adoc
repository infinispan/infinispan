= Distributed memory

{brandname} uses consistent hashing techniques to store a fixed number of copies of each entry in the cache across the cluster.
Distributed caches allow you to scale the data layer linearly, increasing capacity as nodes join.

Distributed caches add redundancy to {brandname} clusters to provide fault tolerance and durability guarantees.
{brandname} deployments typically configure integration with persistent storage to preserve cluster state for graceful shutdowns and restore from backup.
