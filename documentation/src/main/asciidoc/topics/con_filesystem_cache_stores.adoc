= Filesystem-Based Cache Stores
In most cases, filesystem-based cache stores are appropriate for local cache
stores for data that overflows from memory because it exceeds size and/or time
restrictions.

[WARNING]
====
You should not use filesystem-based cache stores on shared file systems such as
an NFS, Microsoft Windows, or Samba share. Shared file systems do not provide
file locking capabilities, which can lead to data corruption.

Likewise, shared file systems are not transactional. If you attempt to use
transactional caches with shared file systems, unrecoverable failures can
happen when writing to files during the commit phase.
