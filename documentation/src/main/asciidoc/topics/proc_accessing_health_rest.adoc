= Accessing Health API using REST

The REST interface lets you access the same set of resources as the CLI. However, the HTTP Management API requires authentication so you must first add credentials with the `add-user.sh` script.

After you set up credentials, access the Health API via REST as in the following examples:

Standalone::
+
[source,bash]
----
include::rest_examples/curl_standalone_health.adoc[]
----

Domain Mode::
+
[source,bash]
----
include::rest_examples/curl_domain_health.adoc[]
----
+
Where `${servername}` is the name of the {brandname} server instance.

The following is a sample result for the REST invocation:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::rest_examples/server_health_rest.adoc[]
