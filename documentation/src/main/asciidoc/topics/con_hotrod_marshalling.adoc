= Hot Rod Java Client Marshalling
Hot Rod is a binary TCP protocol that requires you to transform Java objects
into binary format so they can be transferred over the wire or stored to disk.

By default, {brandname} uses a ProtoStream API to encode and decode Java
objects into Protocol Buffers (Protobuf); a language-neutral, backwards
compatible format. However, you can also implement and use custom marshallers.
