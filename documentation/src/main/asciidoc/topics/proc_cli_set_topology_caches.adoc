= Set a Stable Topology

By default, after a cluster shutdown, {brandname} waits for all nodes to join the cluster and restore the topology.
However, we offer a CLI command to mark the current topology stable for a specific cache.

.Procedure

. Create a CLI connection to {brandname}.
. Do one of the following:
+
* Set the current topology as stable for the given cache.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
topology set-stable cacheName
----
+
* If the current topology is missing more nodes than the number of owners, the force flag is necessary to confirm the operation.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
topology set-stable cacheName -f
----

For more information about the [command]`topology set-stable` command, run [command]`topology set-stable -h`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Manually installing a topology can lead to data loss, only perform this operation if the initial topology cannot be recreated.
