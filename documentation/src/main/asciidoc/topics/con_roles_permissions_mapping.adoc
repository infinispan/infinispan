[id='auth_roles']
= Roles and Permissions Mapping

Applications interact with {brandname} using its API within the same JVM. The two main components which are exposed by the {brandname} API are CacheManagers and Caches. If an application wants to interact with a secured CacheManager and Cache, it should provide an identity which {brandname}â€™s security layer will validate against a set of required roles and permissions. If the identity provided by the user application has sufficient permissions, then access will be granted, otherwise an exception indicating a security violation will be thrown. The identity is represented by the javax.security.auth.Subject class which is a wrapper around multiple Principals, e.g. a user and all the groups it belongs to. Since the Principal name is dependent on the owning system (e.g. a Distinguished Name in LDAP), {brandname} needs to be able to map Principal names to roles.
Roles, in turn, represent one or more permissions. The following diagram shows the relationship between the various elements:
