= Cross-site replication

{brandname} clusters running in different locations can discover and
communicate with each other.

Sites are typically data centers in various geographic locations. Cross-site
replication bridges {brandname} clusters in sites to form global clusters, as
in the following diagram:

**LON** is a datacenter in London, England. +
**NYC** is a datacenter in New York City, USA.

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} can form global clusters across two or more sites.

For example, configure a third {brandname} cluster running in San Francisco,
**SFO**, as backup location for **LON** and **NYC**.
