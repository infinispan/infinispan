= Setting Up SSL Identities
SSL identities use keystores that contain either a certificate or chain of
certificates.

[NOTE]
====
If security realms contain SSL identities, {brandname} servers automatically
enable encryption for the endpoints that use those security realms.
====

.Procedure

. Create a keystore for {brandname} server.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{brandname} server supports the following keystore formats: JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12,
BKS, BCFKS and UBER.

In production environments, server certificates should be signed by a trusted
Certificate Authority, either Root or Intermediate CA.
====
+
. Add the keystore to the `$ISPN_HOME/server/conf` directory.
. Add a `server-identities` definition to the {brandname} server security realm.
. Specify the name of the keystore along with the password and alias.
