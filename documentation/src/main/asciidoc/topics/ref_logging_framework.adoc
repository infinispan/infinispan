= Logging Framework

{brandname} uses the
link:https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logging[JBoss Logging] logging framework.
JBoss Logging acts as a delegator to either JBoss Log Manager, Apache Log4j 2/1.2, Slf4j or JDK Logging.

Normally JBoss Logging picks the first implementation it finds in the classpath,
but you can control which implementation is selected with a system property.
E.g. `-Dorg.jboss.logging.provider=jboss` selects the JBoss Log Manager implementation.

The server uses Apache Log4j 2.x, and the configuration is in
link:https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/main/server/runtime/src/main/server/server/conf/log4j2.xml[`conf/log4j2.xml`].

You can also use the server logging configuration a base for your application's logging configuration in embedded mode, and you can pass it to your system via system parameter (e.g. `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:/path/to/log4j2.xml`).
