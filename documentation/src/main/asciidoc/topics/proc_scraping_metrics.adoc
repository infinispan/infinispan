[id='metric_endpoint']
= Collecting {brandname} Metrics
{brandname} servers provide monitoring data through an HTTP `metrics` endpoint
that exposes OS, JVM, and application-level statistics.

.Procedure

. Start at least one {brandname} server.
. Test the metrics endpoint with any HTTP client, for example:
+
----
curl -v http://localhost:11222/metrics
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you configure {brandname} servers with security, you should include the
appropriate credentials or client certificates to access the metrics endpoint.
====
+
{brandname} responds with monitoring data in JSON format.

.Next steps

Configure monitoring applications to scrape {brandname} metrics from the
endpoint as appropriate. For example, add the following to your
`prometheus.yml` file:

----
static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9090', 'localhost:11222']
----
