= {brandname} Terminology

{brandname} terminology refers to words and phrases specific to {brandname}
capabilities and features. It is important to use consistent terminology across
documentation and the code base to avoid unclear or contradictory language.

Add::
Add an item to an existing list, group, view, or other container element. For example, "add entries to caches".
Opposite to "Remove".

Cache::
A data structure for storing key/value pairs in memory.

Cache configuration::
A resource that instantiates and controls a cache.

Cache template::
Generally means a resource from which you create cache configurations.
{brandname} provides some pre-defined templates (`org.infinispan.\*`).
Users can define new templates in `infinispan.xml` with the `*-cache-configuration*` tags.
In some APIs, you can use the configuration of an existing cache as a template to configure a new cache.

Cache definition::
Refers to a named cache instance. To avoid ambiguity, do not use in UI or documentation to mean "cache configuration".

Cache Manager::
Interface for creating and managing caches. Always spell as two words with capital letters when referring to the abstract notion of a Cache Manager.
When referring to specific interfaces, use `CacheManager`, `EmbeddedCacheManager`, or `RemoteCacheManager`.

Clear::
Delete all the elements of a container. For example, "clear entries in a cache".

Create::
Build something new. For example, "create a cache".
Opposite to "Delete".

Delete::
Permanently remove a single element or a group of similar elements from a container.
For example, "delete an entry from the cache" or "delete all expired entries from the cache".
Opposite to "Create".

Destroy::
Do not use to mean "delete".

Index::
Create an index to improve query performance or add an entry to an existing index when it is added to a cache.

Indexes::
Plural of index.
Do not use "indices".

Off-heap::
Native memory space outside the managed JVM heap.
Always hyphenate when used as an adjective.

Please::
Avoid using the word "please" because it can imply that actions are optional.
Technical documentation should be authoritative and clear.
Saying "please" can make language sound more "human" but politeness is not necessary in technical content.

Purge::
Can have negative connotations and is not a preferred term.
Use only as a synonym for "clear" or "delete" in subsequent descriptions, such as in the body text of a dialog or text that follows a heading.
Do not use as a primary verb or in headings.

Query::
Look up information within the data set.
The words "query" and "search" are synonymous but frequently interchanging the two can lead to inconsistency.
Use in verb form: "Query values in the cache."
Use in noun form preceded by Ickle: "Perform an Ickle query on the cache."

Reindex::
Rebuild an index to update or change an existing index.
Do not hyphenate (always "reindex" never "re-index").

Remove::
Use to describe removing an item from a list, group, view, or other container element without.
Opposite to "Add".
+
Can also use as a synonym for "clear" or "delete" in subsequent descriptions, such as in the body text of a dialog or text that follows a heading.
Do not use as a primary verb or in headings to mean "clear" or "delete".
Prefer using "Permanently remove" when describing the action to "delete" or "clear".
