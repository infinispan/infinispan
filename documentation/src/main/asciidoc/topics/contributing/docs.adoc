[[documentation_guidelines]]
== Documentation Guidelines

Welcome to {brandname} documentation. This is a place where anyone can
contribute and share their knowledge.

[[documentation_guidelines_source_files]]
=== Working with Documentation Source Files

All you need to do is fork {brandname} to edit the documentation source files.
You can then submit your changes in a _pull request_ as you would any other
contribution to the project.

See the `README` file in the _documentation/src/main/asciidoc_ directory for
information on what you need to edit and build the documentation.

[[documentation_guidelines_style_guide]]
=== Style Guide

Infinispan is the community project on which Red Hat Data Grid is based. For
this reason, we follow link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/[Guidelines
for Red Hat Documentation].

The link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoctor
Writer's Guide] also has some excellent resources on writing effective
documentation.

[[documentation_guidelines_format_reference]]
=== AsciiDoc Format Reference

Tips for which AsciiDoc markup to use when formatting text.

Monospace (```)::
[cols="50%,50%",options="header"]

|Item |Example
|File names and paths |The \`/home/user/.bashrc` file ...
|Literal values | If the value is \`true` ...
|Configuration attributes | Set the \`enabled` attribute ...
|Java class names |The \`java.sql.Connection` class ...
|Java annotations |The \`@Clustered` annotation ...
|===

Italics (`_`)::
[cols="50%,50%",options="header"]

|Item |Example
|Guide titles |See the \_Installation Guide_ ...
|Emphasis _(first occurrence of the term only)_ |\_High availability_ refers to the ...

[[documentation_guidelines_general]]
=== General Guidelines

* Always use `++{brandname}++` to refer to the product. Never abbreviate the product name to something like "ISPN".
* Prefer active voice to passive voice.
* Use the second or third person, but never the first. Prefer second person singular to address the user directly.
* Always use the present tense. There are instances where future tense makes sense but do not mix tenses. Never use the past tense.
* Use American English spelling conventions.
* Avoid contractions. Use "do not" instead of "don't".
* Terminate bulleted and numbered lists with periods (.) except for simple name
  lists.
* Avoid the word "simply" unless it clarifies.
* For substitution of `{attr}` in code blocks, use `[subs=+attributes]`.
* For styling of `++*bold*++` (`*bold*`) in code blocks, use
  `[subs=+quotes]`.
* Never use colloquialisms or slang in documentation.

|Root commands  | $ sudo  |#
|Emphasis  |\_yay_  |\*yay*
|Decimal integers < 10  |four  |4
|Decimal integers >= 10  |12  |twelve
|Hexadecimal integers (_always numeric, lowercase x_) |0x123 |0X13
|Number ranges (_always use numerals_)  |1-20 |1-twenty

Characters Per Line::
Use a soft limit of 80 characters per line. This makes it easier to see changes
in GitHub diffs, which are about 90 characters long.
Asciidoc End of File::
To avoid formatting issues, end `adoc` files with two empty lines.
Notes and Admonitions::
Encapsulate notes, tips, and warnings in brackets. Surround the text in four equals characters, as follows:
+
----
[NOTE]
====
This is a note that you should read.
====
----

[[documentation_guidelines_section_ids]]
=== Section IDs

When creating anchors for section IDs, use the following format:

`++[[anchor_name]]++`

You should always use underscores (_) to delimit anchors. Do not use other characters such as dashes (-) or periods (.) to avoid issues at build time.

To create anchors for reusable content, use this format:

`++[id="same-as-section-heading-{context}"]++`

Learn more about content reuse in the link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#reusing-modules[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].

[[documentation_guidelines_xrefs]]
=== Cross References

To reference a section within the same book, use `link:#`:

`++link:#anchor_name[Link Text]++`

[[documentation_guidelines_images]]
=== Diagrams, Screenshots, and Other Media

* Images should be saved as *PNG* or *JPG*, with a width of at least *660 px*, at *110 dpi*. Try to keep file size less than *300 KB*.
* Screenshots supplement the text, not replace it.  *Do not use images as the sole means to convey information or context*.
* *Do not include any test or pre-release labels*.
* *Do not include any personally identifying information*.
* Capture just the part of the screen or window that users must focus on; *do not include window headers in the final screenshots unless completely necessary*.
* Crop screenshots to *condense important information* and limit empty GUI space and other inconsequential parts.
* All information in an image must be available in an alternative text format for accessibility (Section 508).
* Save all images under `documentation/src/main/asciidoc/${your_document}/images`

[[documentation_guidelines_images_include]]
==== Including Images
Insert images using the `image::` or `image:` directive.

* Example 1: Image title in title case (which automatically appends a Figure #).
+
----
.Image Title
image::icon.png[Alt text, 50, 50]
----

* Example 2: Inline image. Note, there is only one colon (:) used here.
+
----
This is an inline image. image:icon.png[Alt text] Cool!
----

[[documentation_guidelines_code_blocks]]
=== Code Samples

Include code samples in blocks such as the following:

----
  [source,java,options="nowrap"]
  .MyClass.java
  ----
  //some Java code
  ----
----

[TIP]
====
Include code samples that demonstrate an idea. To share reusable blocks of code or configuration files, store them in GitHub
as a link:https://gist.github.com/[gist] and linking to them.
