= {brandname} Server patches

{brandname} Server patches are `.zip` archives that contain artifacts that you can apply to your `{server_home}` directory to fix issues and add new features.

Patches also provide a set of rules for {brandname} Server to modify your installation.
When you apply patches, {brandname} overwrites some files and removes others, depending on if they are required for the target version.

However, {brandname} does not make any changes to configuration files that you have created or modified when applying a patch.
Server patches do not modify or replace any custom configuration or data.

ifdef::downstream[]
The {brandname} command line interface (CLI) includes a [command]`patch create` command that lets you create custom patches.
However this command is intended for use only for Infinispan Server, or community, deployments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{RedHat} supports patched deployments only with patches that you
download from the {portal}.
{RedHat} does not support server patches that you create yourself.
