= {brandname} Server Patches
{brandname} server patches are `.zip` archives that contain artifacts that you
can apply to your `{server_home}` directory to fix issues and add new features.

Patches also provide a set of rules for {brandname} to modify your server
installation. When you apply patches, {brandname} overwrites some files and
removes others, depending on if they are required for the target version.

However, {brandname} does not make any changes to configuration files that you
have created or modified when applying a patch. Server patches do not modify or
replace any custom configuration or data.
