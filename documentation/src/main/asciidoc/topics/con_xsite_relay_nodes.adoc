= Relay Nodes

Relay nodes are the nodes in {brandname} clusters that are responsible for
sending and receiving requests from backup locations.

If a node is not a relay node, it must forward backup requests to a local relay node.
Only relay nodes can send requests to backup locations.

For optimal performance, you should configure all nodes as relay nodes.
This increases the speed of backup requests because each node in the cluster can
backup to remote sites directly without having to forward backup requests to
local relay nodes.


[NOTE]
====
Diagrams in this document illustrate {brandname} clusters with one relay node
because this is the default for the JGroups RELAY2 protocol.
Likewise, a single relay node is easier to illustrate because each relay node in a cluster
communicates with each relay node in the remote cluster.

[NOTE]
====
In JGroups configuration, the relay nodes are called "site master".
