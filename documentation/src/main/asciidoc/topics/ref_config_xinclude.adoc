[id='cache_xinclude-{context}']
= Multiple Configuration Files
{brandname} supports XML inclusions (XInclude) that allow you to split configuration across multiple files.

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/config_xincluded.xml[]
----

If you want to use a schema for your included fragments, use the `infinispan-config-fragment-{schemaversion}.xsd` schema:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/config_xincluded_with_schema.xml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} configuration provides only minimal support for the XInclude specification. For example, you cannot use the `xpointer` attribute, the `xi:fallback` element, text processing, or content negotiation.
