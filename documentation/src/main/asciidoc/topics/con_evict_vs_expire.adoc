= Eviction and Expiration Overview
Eviction and expiration are two strategies that have similar results in that
they remove old, unused entries. Although eviction and expiration are similar,
they have some important differences that you should take into account when
planning your configuration.

* [*] Eviction lets {brandname} control the size of the data container by removing entries when the container becomes larger than a configured threshold.

* [*] Expiration limits the amount of time entries can exist. {brandname} uses
a scheduler to periodically remove expired entries. Entries that are expired
but not yet removed are immediately removed on access; in this case `get()`
calls for expired entries return "null" values.

* [*] Eviction is local to {brandname} nodes.

* [*] Expiration takes place across {brandname} clusters.

* [*] You can use eviction and expiration together or independently of each other.

* [*] You can configure eviction and expiration declaratively in `infinispan.xml` to apply cache-wide defaults for entries.

* [*] You can explicitly define expiration settings for specific entries but you cannot define eviction on a per-entry basis.

* [*] You can manually evict entries and manually trigger expiration.
