{brandname} Server as a standalone process requires a Java Virtual Machine and works with Java {jdkminversion} and later.

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} Server does not support versions prior to Java {jdkminversion}. However, you can use Hot Rod clients from older versions
of {brandname} which still work fine with more recent servers. See the link:{hotrod_docs}#client-server-compatibility_hotrod-java-client[Hot Rod compatibility documentation] for more details.
