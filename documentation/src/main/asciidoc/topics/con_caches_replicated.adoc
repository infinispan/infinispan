= Replicated Caches
Entries written to a replicated cache on any node will be replicated to all other nodes
in the cluster, and can be retrieved locally from any node.
Replicated mode provides a quick and easy way to share state across a cluster,
however replication practically only performs well in small clusters (under 10 nodes),
due to the number of messages needed for a write scaling linearly with the cluster size.
{brandname} can be configured to use UDP multicast, which mitigates this problem to some
degree.

Each key has a primary owner, which serializes data container updates in order to
provide consistency.
To find more about how primary owners are assigned, please read the
link:#key_ownership[Key Ownership] section.

Replicated mode can be synchronous or asynchronous.

* Synchronous replication blocks the caller (e.g. on a `cache.put(key, value)`) until
the modifications have been replicated successfully to all the nodes in the cluster.
* Asynchronous replication performs replication in the background, and write operations
return immediately.
Asynchronous replication is not recommended, because communication errors, or errors
that happen on remote nodes are not reported to the caller.

If transactions are enabled, write operations are not replicated through the primary
owner.

* With pessimistic locking, each write triggers a lock message, which is
broadcast to all the nodes.
During transaction commit, the originator broadcasts a one-phase prepare message and an
unlock message (optional).
Either the one-phase prepare or the unlock message is fire-and-forget.

* With optimistic locking, the originator broadcasts a prepare message, a commit message,
and an unlock message (optional).
Again, either the one-phase prepare or the unlock message is fire-and-forget.
