= Cache Loaders and Transactional Caches
Only JDBC String-Based cache stores support transactional operations. If you
configure caches as transactional, you should set `transactional=true` to keep
data in persistent storage synchronized with data in memory.

For all other cache stores, {brandname} does not enlist cache loaders in
transactional operations. This can result in data inconsistency if transactions
succeed in modifying data in memory but do not completely apply changes to data
in the cache store. In this case manual recovery does not work with cache
stores.
