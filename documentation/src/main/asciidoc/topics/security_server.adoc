== Security Concepts

=== Authorization

Just like embedded mode, the server supports cache authorization using the same configuration, e.g.:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/cache_authorization.xml[]
----

=== Server Realms

{brandname} Server security is built around the features provided by the underlying server realm and security domains.
Security Realms are used by the server to provide authentication and authorization information for both the management and application interfaces.

.Security Realm configuration
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/server_realm_config.xml[]
----

{brandname} Server comes with an add-user.sh script (add-user.bat for Windows) to ease the process of adding new user/role mappings to the above property files.
An example invocation for adding a user to the ApplicationRealm with an initial set of roles:

+./bin/add-user.sh -a -u myuser -p "qwer1234!" -ro supervisor,reader,writer+

It is also possible to authenticate/authorize against alternative sources, such as LDAP, JAAS, etc.

Bear in mind that the choice of authentication mechanism you select for the protocols limits the type of authentication sources, since the credentials must be in a format supported by the algorithm itself (e.g. pre-digested passwords for the digest algorithm)

[[security_hotrod_auth]]
== Hot Rod Authentication

The Hot Rod protocol supports authentication by leveraging the SASL mechanisms.
The supported SASL mechanisms (usually shortened as mechs) are:

* PLAIN - This is the most insecure mech, since credentials are sent over the wire in plain-text format, however it is the simplest to get to work. In combination with encryption (i.e. TLS) it can be used safely
* DIGEST-MD5 - This mech hashes the credentials before sending them over the wire, so it is more secure than PLAIN
* GSSAPI - This mech uses Kerberos tickets, and therefore requires the presence of a properly configured Kerberos Domain Controller (such as Microsoft Active Directory)
* EXTERNAL - This mech obtains credentials from the underlying transport (i.e. from a X.509 client certificate) and therefore requires encryption using client-certificates to be enabled.

The following configuration enables authentication against ApplicationRealm, using the DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism and only enables the *auth* QoP (see link:#security_saslqop[SASL Quality of Protection]):

.Hot Rod connector configuration
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/hotrod_connector_sasl.xml[]
----
Notice the server-name attribute: it is the name that the server declares to incoming clients and therefore the client configuration must match.
It is particularly important when using GSSAPI as it is equivalent to the Kerberos service name.
You can specify multiple mechanisms and they will be attempted in order.

[[security_saslqop]]
=== SASL Quality of Protection

While the main purpose of SASL is to provide authentication, some mechanisms also support integrity and privacy protection, also known as Quality of Protection (or qop).
During authentication negotiation, ciphers are exchanged between client and server, and they can be used to add checksums and encryption to all subsequent traffic.
You can tune the required level of qop as follows:

[%header%autowidth]
|===
| QOP | Description
| auth | Authentication only
| auth-int | Authentication with integrity protection
| auth-conf | Authentication with integrity and privacy protection
|===

=== SASL Policies

You can further refine the way a mechanism is chosen by tuning the SASL policies.
This will effectively include / exclude mechanisms based on whether they match the desired policies.

[%header%autowidth]
|===
| Policy | Description
| forward-secrecy | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must support forward secrecy between sessions. This means that breaking into one session will not automatically provide information for breaking into future sessions.
| pass-credentials | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must require client credentials.
| no-plain-text | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
| no-active | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to active (non-dictionary) attacks. The mechanism might require mutual authentication as a way to prevent active attacks.
| no-dictionary | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to passive dictionary attacks.
| no-anonymous | Specifies that the selected SASL mechanism must not accept anonymous logins.
|===

Each policy's value is either "true" or "false".
If a policy is absent, then the chosen mechanism need not have that characteristic (equivalent to setting the policy to "false").
One notable exception is the *no-anonymous* policy which, if absent, defaults to true, thus preventing anonymous connections.

NOTE: It is possible to have mixed anonymous and authenticated connections to the endpoint, delegating actual access logic to cache
authorization configuration. To do so, set the *no-anonymous* policy to false and turn on cache authorization.

The following configuration selects all available mechanisms, but effectively only enables GSSAPI, since it is the only one that respects all chosen policies:

.Hot Rod connector policies
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/hotrod_connector_policies.xml[]
----

=== Using GSSAPI/Kerberos

If you want to use GSSAPI/Kerberos, setup and configuration differs. First we need to define a Kerberos login module using the security domain subsystem:

.Security domain configuration
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/security_domain.xml[]
----

Next we need to modify the Hot Rod connector

.Hot Rod connector configuration
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/hotrod_connector_gssapi.xml[]
----

[[security_hotrod_rest_encryption]]
== Hot Rod and REST encryption (TLS/SSL)

Both Hot Rod and REST protocols support encryption using SSL/TLS with optional TLS/SNI support (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[Server Name Indication]). To set this up you need to create a keystore using the +keytool+ application which is part of the JDK to store your server certificate. Then add a +<server-identities>+ element to your security realm:

.Security Realm configuration for SSL
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/security_realm_application.xml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
When using SNI support there might be multiple Security Realms configured.
====

It is also possible to generate development certificates on server startup. In order to do this, just specify `generate-self-signed-certificate-host`
in the keystore element as shown below:

.Generating Keystore automatically
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/security_realm_application_generate_cert.xml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
There are three basic principles that you should remember when using automatically generated keystores:

- They shouldn't be used on a production environment
- They are generated when necessary (e.g. while obtaining the first connection from the client)
- They contain also certificates so they might be used in a Hot Rod client directly
====

Next modify the +<hotrod-connector>+ and/or +<rest-connector>+ elements in the endpoint subsystem to require encryption.
Optionally add SNI configuration:

.Hot Rod connector SSL configuration
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/hotrod_connector_ssl_config.xml[]
----

NOTE: To configure the client In order to connect to the server using the Hot Rod protocol, the client needs a trust store containing the public key
of the server(s) you are going to connect to, unless the key was signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by
the JRE.

[source,java]
----
ConfigurationBuilder clientBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
clientBuilder
    .addServer()
        .host("127.0.0.1")
        .port(11222)
     .security()
        .ssl()
           .enabled(true)
           .sniHostName("domain1")
           .trustStoreFileName("truststore_client.jks")
           .trustStorePassword("secret".toCharArray());
remoteCacheManager = new RemoteCacheManager(clientBuilder.build());
----

Additionally, you might also want to enable client certificate authentication (and optionally also allow the use of the
EXTERNAL SASL mech to authenticate and authorize clients).
To enable this you will need the security realm on the server to be able to trust incoming client certificates by adding
a trust store:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/security_realm_application_keystore.xml[]
----

And then tell the connector to require a client certificate:

[source,xml]
----
include::config_examples/hotrod_connector_require_client_cert.xml[]
----

The client, at this point, will also need to specify a keyStore which contains its certificate on top of the trustStore which trusts the server certificate.
