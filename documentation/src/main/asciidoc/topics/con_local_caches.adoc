[id='local-caches_{context}']
= Local caches

{brandname} offers a local cache mode that is similar to a `ConcurrentHashMap`.

Caches offer more capabilities than simple maps, including write-through and
write-behind to persistent storage as well as management capabilities such as eviction and expiration.

The {brandname} `AsyncCache` API extends the `ConcurrentMap` API in Java, making it easy to migrate from a map to a {brandname} cache.
