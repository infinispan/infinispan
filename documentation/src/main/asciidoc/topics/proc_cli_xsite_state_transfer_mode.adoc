= Configuring Cross-Site State Transfer Modes
You can configure cross-site state transfer operations to happen automatically when {brandname} detects that backup locations come online.
Alternatively you can use the default mode, which is to manually perform state transfer through the CLI or via JMX or REST.

.Procedure

. Create a CLI connection to {brandname}.
. Use the [command]`site` command to configure state transfer modes, as in the following examples:

* Retrieve the current state transfer mode.
+
----
[//containers/default]> site state-transfer-mode get --cache=cacheName --site=NYC
"MANUAL"
----

* Configure automatic state transfer operations for a cache and backup location.
----
[//containers/default]> site state-transfer-mode set --cache=cacheName --site=NYC --mode=AUTO
----

[TIP]
====
Run the [command]`help site` command for more information and examples.
