= Hot Rod client tracing propagation
The HotRod client fully supports the OpenTelemetry tracing propagation from the client to the Infinispan server.

It means that if the OpenTelemetry tracing is configured both on client VM and on the {brandname} server,
any tracing span generated by the client application will be automatically correlated by the HotRod client
with the dependent Infinispan server spans.

To configure OpenTelemetry tracing on the {brandname} server
see link:{server_docs}#opentelemetry-tracing[the {brandname} Server documentation].

For any reason it is possible to disable the tracing propagation.

.Procedure

. On Hot Rod client configuration use `disableTracingPropagation()` method.
