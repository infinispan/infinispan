= Memcached
{brandname} provides an implementation of the Memcached text protocol for remote client access.

The {brandname} Memcached server supports clustering with replicated and
distributed cache modes.

There are some Memcached client implementations, such as the Cache::Memcached
Perl client, that can offer load balancing and failover detection capabilities
with static lists of {brandname} server addresses that require manual updates
when cluster topology changes occur.
