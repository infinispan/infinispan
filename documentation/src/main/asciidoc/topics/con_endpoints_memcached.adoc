[id='endpoints-memcached_{context}']
= Memcached
{brandname} provides an implementation of the Memcached text protocol for
remote client access.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Memcached endpoint is deprecated and planned for removal in a future
release.
====

The {brandname} Memcached endpoint supports clustering with replicated and
distributed cache modes.

There are some Memcached client implementations, such as the Cache::Memcached
Perl client, that can offer load balancing and failover detection capabilities
with static lists of {brandname} server addresses that require manual updates
when cluster topology changes occur.
