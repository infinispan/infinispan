= Concurrent Writes and Conflicting Entries
Conflicting entries can occur with Active/Active site configurations if clients
write to the same entries at the same time but at different sites.

For example, client A writes to "k1" in **LON** at the same time that client B
writes to "k1" in **NYC**. In this case, "k1" has a different value in **LON**
than in **NYC**. After replication occurs, there is no guarantee which value
for "k1" exists at which site.

To ensure data consistency, {brandname} uses a vector clock algorithm to detect
conflicting entries during backup operations, as in the following illustration:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
            LON       NYC

k1=(n/a)    0,0       0,0

k1=2        1,0  -->  1,0   k1=2

k1=3        1,1  <--  1,1   k1=3

k1=5        2,1       1,2   k1=8

                 -->  2,1 (conflict)
(conflict)  1,2  <--
----

Vector clocks are timestamp metadata that increment with each write to an
entry. In the preceding example, `0,0` represents the initial value for the
vector clock on "k1".

A client puts "k1=2" in **LON** and the vector clock is `1,0`, which
{brandname} replicates to **NYC**. A client then puts "k1=3" in **NYC** and the
vector clock updates to `1,1`, which {brandname} replicates to **LON**.

However if a client puts "k1=5" in **LON** at the same time that a client puts
"k1=8" in **NYC**, {brandname} detects a conflicting entry because the vector
value for "k1" is not strictly greater or less between **LON** and **NYC**.

When it finds conflicting entries, {brandname} uses the Java `compareTo(String
anotherString)` method to compare site names. To determine which key takes
priority, {brandname} selects the site name that is lexicographically less
than the other. Keys from a site named **AAA** take priority over keys from a
site named **AAB** and so on.

Following the same example, to resolve the conflict for "k1", {brandname} uses
the value for "k1" that originates from **LON**. This results in "k1=5" in both
**LON** and **NYC** after {brandname} resolves the conflict and replicates the
value.

[TIP]
====
Prepend site names with numbers as a simple way to represent the order of
priority for resolving conflicting entries; for example, **1LON** and **2NYC**.
