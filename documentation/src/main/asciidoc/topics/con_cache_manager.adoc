[id='cache_managers-{context}']
= Cache Managers
{brandname} provides a `CacheManager` interface that lets you create, modify,
and manage local or clustered caches. Cache Managers are the starting point for
using {brandname} caches.

There are two `CacheManager` implementations:

`EmbeddedCacheManager`::
Entry point for caches when running {brandname} inside the same Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) as the client application, which is also known as Library Mode.

`RemoteCacheManager`::
Entry point for caches when running {brandname} as a remote server in its own
JVM. When it starts running, `RemoteCacheManager` establishes a persistent TCP connection to a Hot Rod endpoint on a {brandname} server.

[NOTE]
====
Both embedded and remote `CacheManager` implementations share some methods and
properties. However, semantic differences do exist between
`EmbeddedCacheManager` and `RemoteCacheManager`.
