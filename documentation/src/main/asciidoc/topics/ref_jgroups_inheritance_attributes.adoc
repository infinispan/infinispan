= Inheritance Attributes
When you extend a JGroups stack, inheritance attributes let you adjust protocols and properties in the stack you are extending.

* `stack.position` specifies protocols to modify.
* `stack.combine` uses the following values to extend JGroups stacks:

| Value
| Description

| `COMBINE`
| Overrides protocol properties.

| `REPLACE`
| Replaces protocols.

| `INSERT_AFTER`
| Adds a protocol into the stack after another protocol.
Does not affect the protocol that you specify as the insertion point.

Protocols in JGroups stacks affect each other based on their location in the stack.
For example, you should put a protocol such as `NAKACK2` after the `SYM_ENCRYPT` or `ASYM_ENCRYPT` protocol so that `NAKACK2` is secured.

| `REMOVE`
| Removes protocols from the stack.
