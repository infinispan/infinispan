= JDBC_PING
JDBC_PING uses shared databases to store information about {brandname} clusters.
This protocol supports any database that can use a JDBC connection.

Nodes write their IP addresses to the shared database so joining nodes can find the {brandname} cluster on the network.
When nodes leave {brandname} clusters, they delete their IP addresses from the shared database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Add the appropriate JDBC driver to the classpath so {brandname} can use JDBC_PING.
