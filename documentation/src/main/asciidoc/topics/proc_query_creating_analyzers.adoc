= Creating custom analyzer definitions
You can create custom analyzer definitions and add them to {brandname}.

.Procedure

. Create an implementation of the `ProgrammaticSearchMappingProvider` interface packaged in a `JAR` file.
. Provide a file named `org.infinispan.query.spi.ProgrammaticSearchMappingProvider` in the `META-INF/services/` directory of your `JAR`. This file should contain the fully qualified class name of your implementation.

For remote caches, you must copy the `JAR` to the `lib/` directory of your {brandname} Server installation.

Your JAR must be available to {brandname} Server during startup.
You cannot add libraries to running servers.
