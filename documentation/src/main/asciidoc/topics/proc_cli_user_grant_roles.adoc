= Granting roles to users

Assign roles to users and grant them permissions to perform cache operations and interact with {brandname} resources.

[TIP]
====
Grant roles to groups instead of users if you want to assign the same role to multiple users and centrally maintain their permissions.
====

.Prerequisites

* Have `ADMIN` permissions for {brandname}.
* Create {brandname} users.

.Procedure

. Create a CLI connection to {brandname}.
. Assign roles to users with the [command]`user roles grant` command, for example:
+
[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
[//containers/default]> user roles grant --roles=deployer katie
----

.Verification

List roles that you grant to users with the [command]`user roles ls` command.

[source,sh,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
[//containers/default]> user roles ls katie
["deployer"]
----
