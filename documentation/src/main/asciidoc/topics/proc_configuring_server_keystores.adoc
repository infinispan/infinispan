= Configuring {brandname} Server Keystores
Add keystores to {brandname} Server and configure it to present SSL/TLS certificates that verify its identity to clients.
If a security realm contains TLS/SSL identities, it encrypts any connections to {brandname} Server endpoints that use that security realm.

.Prerequisites

* Create a keystore that contains certificates, or certificate chains, for {brandname} Server.

{brandname} Server supports the following keystore formats: JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12,
BKS, BCFKS, and UBER.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In production environments, server certificates should be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, either Root or Intermediate CA.
====

.Procedure

. Add the keystore that contains SSL/TLS identities for {brandname} Server to the `{server_home}/server/conf` directory.
. Add a `server-identities` definition to the {brandname} Server security realm.
. Specify the keystore file name with the `path` attribute.
. Provide the keystore password and certificate alias with the `keystore-password` and `alias` attributes.
