= Downloading the Server Distribution
To get started using the server, download the {brandname} Server distribution, unpack it to a local directory and launch it using the +bin/standalone.sh+ or +bin/standalone.bat+ scripts depending on your platform.
This will start a single-node server using the +standalone/configuration/standalone.xml+ configuration file, with four endpoints, one for each of the supported protocols.
These endpoints allow access to all of the caches configured in the {brandname} subsystem (apart from the Memcached endpoint which, because of the protocol's design, only allows access to a single cache).
