= MCP Resources

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to expose resources to clients.
Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas,
or application-specific information.
Each resource is uniquely identified by a URI.

== Available Resources

{brandname} exposes the following predefined resources through the MCP server:

=== Server Log
*URI*: `infinispan+logs://server?lines=200`

*Name*: server log

*MIME Type*: text/plain

*Description*: PRIMARY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SERVER STATUS/HEALTH. Returns info about server status, health, errors, warnings, exceptions, startup/shutdown events, and troubleshooting.

*Usage*: This resource provides access to the main server log file, which contains comprehensive information about the {brandname} server's operations, including startup sequences, configuration details, error messages, warnings, and general operational events. It is the primary resource for monitoring server health and troubleshooting issues.

*Example URI*:
[source]
----
infinispan+logs://server?lines=200
----

=== Audit Log
*URI*: `infinispan+logs://audit?lines=200`

*Name*: audit log

*MIME Type*: text/plain

*Description*: PRIMARY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SERVER STATUS/SECURITY. Returns info about security events: authentication attempts, authorization failures, suspicious activity.

*Usage*: This resource provides access to the audit log, which tracks all security-related events on the server. Use this resource to monitor authentication attempts, detect authorization failures, and identify potential security threats or suspicious activities.

*Example URI*:
[source]
----
infinispan+logs://audit?lines=200
----

=== REST Access Log
*URI*: `infinispan+logs://rest-access?lines=200`

*Name*: REST access log

*MIME Type*: text/plain

*Description*: PRIMARY SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SERVER STATUS/WORKLOAD. Returns info about REST API usage patterns: request rates, errors (4xx/5xx), slow endpoints, client IPs. Useful also for security auditing, i.e. detecting DoS attacks or suspicious activity.

*Usage*: This resource provides access to the REST API access log, which records all HTTP requests to the {brandname} REST endpoint. Analyze this log to understand API usage patterns, identify performance bottlenecks, detect errors, and monitor client activity. It's also valuable for security auditing to detect denial-of-service attacks or unusual access patterns.

*Example URI*:
[source]
----
infinispan+logs://rest-access?lines=200

== Resource Parameters

=== lines Parameter
The `lines` parameter controls how many lines to retrieve from log resources.

*Default*: 200

*Minimum*: 1

*Maximum*: 10000

*Example*:
