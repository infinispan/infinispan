= Configuring Network Firewalls for Remote Connections
Adjust any firewall rules to allow traffic between the server and external
clients.

.Procedure

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) workstations, for example, you can allow
traffic to port `11222` with firewalld as follows:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-port=11222/tcp --permanent
success
# firewall-cmd --list-ports | grep 11222
11222/tcp
----

To configure firewall rules that apply across a network, you can use the
nftables utility.
