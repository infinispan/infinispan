= Eviction
Eviction provides a way to manage how much memory {brandname} uses.

{brandname} lets you configure the maximum size of the data container. Eviction
removes entries from the cache to ensure that {brandname} does not exceed that
maximum size.

[NOTE]
====
Eviction removes entries from memory but not from persistent cache stores.
