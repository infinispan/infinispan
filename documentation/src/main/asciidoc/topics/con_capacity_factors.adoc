= Capacity factors
Capacity factors allocate segment-to-node mappings based on resources available
to nodes.

To configure capacity factors, you specify any non-negative number and the
{brandname} hashing algorithm assigns each node a load weighted by its
capacity factor (both as a primary owner and as a backup owner).

For example, nodeA has 2x the memory available than nodeB in the same
{brandname} cluster. In this case, setting `capacityFactor` to a value of `2`
configures {brandname} to allocate 2x the number of segments to nodeA.

Setting a capacity factor of `0` is possible but is recommended only in cases
where nodes are not joined to the cluster long enough to be useful data owners.
