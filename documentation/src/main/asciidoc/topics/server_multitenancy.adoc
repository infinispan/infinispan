= Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy allows accessing multiple containers as shown below:

Currently there are two supported protocols for accessing the data - using Hot Rod client and using REST interface.

== Using REST interface

Multi-tenancy router uses URL prefixes to separate containers using the following template: `https://<server_ip>:<server_port>/rest/<rest_connector_name>/<cache_name>/<key>`. All HTTP operations remain exactly the same as using standard `rest-connector`.

The REST connector by default support both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. The switching from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 procedure involves
either using TLS/ALPN negotiation or HTTP/1.1 upgrade procedure. The former requires proper encryption to be enabled. The latter
is always enabled.

== Using Hot Rod client

Multi-tenant routing for binary protocols requires using a standard, transport layer mechanism such as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SSL/TLS Server Name Indication]. The server needs to be configured to support encryption and additional SNI routing needs to be added to the `router-connector`.

In order to connect to a secured Hot Rod server, the client needs to use configuration similar to this:

[source,java]
----
ConfigurationBuilder clientBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
clientBuilder
    .addServer()
        .host("127.0.0.1")
        .port(hotrodServer.getPort())
     .security()
        .ssl()
           .enabled(sslClient)
           .sniHostName("hotrod-1") // SNI Host Name
           .trustStoreFileName("truststore.jks")
           .trustStorePassword("secret".toCharArray());
remoteCacheManager = new RemoteCacheManager(clientBuilder.build());
----

=== Multi-tenant router

The Multi-tenant router endpoint works as a facade for one or more REST/Hot Rod connectors. Its main purpose is to forward client requests into proper container.

In order to properly configure the routing, `socket-binding` attributes of other connectors must be disabled and additional attribute `name` must be used as shown below:

[source,xml]
----

<rest-connector name="rest-1" cache-container="local"/>
<rest-connector name="rest-2" cache-container="local"/>
<hotrod-connector name="hotrod-1" cache-container="local" />
<hotrod-connector name="hotrod-2" cache-container="local" />

----

The next step is to add a new `router-connector` endpoint and configure how other containers will be accessed. Note that Hot Rod connectors require using TLS/SNI and REST connectors require using prefix in the URL:

[source,xml]
----

<router-connector hotrod-socket-binding="hotrod" rest-socket-binding="rest" keep-alive="true" tcp-nodelay="false" receive-buffer-size="1024" send-buffer-size="1024">
    <hotrod name="hotrod-1" >
        <sni host-name="hotrod-1" security-realm="SSLRealm1"/>
    </hotrod>
    <hotrod name="hotrod-2" >
        <sni host-name="hotrod-2" security-realm="SSLRealm2"/>
    </hotrod>
    <rest name="rest-1">
        <prefix path="rest-1" />
    </rest>
    <rest name="rest-2">
        <prefix path="rest-2" />
    </rest>
</router-connector>

----

With the following configuration, Hot Rod clients will access `hotrod-1` connector when using SNI Host Name "hotrod-1".
REST clients will need to use the following URL to access "rest-1" connector - `https://<server_ip>:<server_port>/rest/rest-1`.
