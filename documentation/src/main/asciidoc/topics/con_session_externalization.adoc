Application Elasticity::
Externalizing HTTP sessions to {brandname} keeps your {wildflybrandname} application cluster stateless, which eliminates the need to re-balance data when nodes join or leave {wildflybrandname} clusters. Likewise, when you upgrade your {wildflybrandname} cluster, nodes can retrieve sessions as you bring them online so that you do not experience downtime during the upgrade.

Session Failover Across Data Centers::
When data centers can go offline, load balancers redirect incoming requests to {wildflybrandname} clusters running in a different locations. Applications can seamlessly retrieve the session data from {brandname} when this failover occurs so that there is no loss of service.

Reduced Memory Footprint::
Offloading session data from your application layer to {brandname} increases performance and improves memory optimization operations like garbage collection.
