= Session externalization

{brandname} can provide external caches for applications built on {quarkusbrandname}, {wildflybrandname}, {tomcatbrandname}, and Spring.
These external caches store HTTP sessions and other data independently of the application layer.

Externalizing sessions to {brandname} gives you the following benefits:

Elasticity:: Eliminate the need for rebalancing operations when scaling applications.
Smaller memory footprints:: Storing session data in external caches reduces overall memory requirements for applications.
