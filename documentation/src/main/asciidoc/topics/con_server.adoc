= {brandname} Server
{brandname} Server is a standalone server which exposes any number of caches to clients over a variety of protocols, including HotRod, Memcached and REST.

The server itself is built on top of the robust foundation provided by WildFly, therefore delegating services such as management, configuration, datasources, transactions, logging, security to the respective subsystems.

Because {brandname} Server is closely tied to the latest releases of {brandname} and JGroups, the subsystems which control these components are different, in that they introduce new features and change some existing ones (e.g. cross-site replication, etc).

For this reason, the configuration of these subsystems should use the {brandname} Server-specific schema, although for most use-cases the configuration is interchangeable.
