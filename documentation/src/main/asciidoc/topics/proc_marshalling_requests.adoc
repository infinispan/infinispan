= Custom Marshaller Bridges
{brandname} provides two marshalling bridges for marshalling client/server requests using the Kryo and Protostuff libraries.
To utilise either of these marshallers, you simply place the dependency of the marshaller you require in your client
pom. Custom schemas for object marshalling must then be registered with the selected library using the library's api on
the client or by implementing a RegistryService for the given marshaller bridge. Examples of how to achieve this for both
libraries are presented below:
