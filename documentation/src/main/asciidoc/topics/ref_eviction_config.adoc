= Eviction
To define eviction for a cache, add the `<memory/>` element as follows:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/eviction.xml[]
----

The possible attributes for the eviction element are:


*  _strategy_ sets the cache eviction strategy. Available options are 'UNORDERED', 'FIFO', 'LRU', 'LIRS' and 'NONE' (to disable eviction).
*  _max-entries_ maximum number of entries in a cache instance. If selected value is not a power of two the actual value will default to the least power of two larger than selected value. -1 means no limit.
