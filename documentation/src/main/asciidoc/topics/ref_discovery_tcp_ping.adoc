= TCPPING
TCPPING is a generic JGroups discovery mechanism that uses a list of static addresses for cluster members.

With TCPPING, you manually specify the IP address or hostname of each node in the {brandname} cluster as part of the JGroups stack, rather than letting nodes discover each other dynamically.
