= TCPPING
`TCPPING` is a generic JGroups discovery mechanism that uses a static list of IP
addresses for cluster members.

To use `TCPPING`, you must add the list of static IP addresses to the JGroups
configuration file for each {brandname} node. However, the drawback to
`TCPPING` is that it does not allow nodes to dynamically join {brandname}
clusters.
