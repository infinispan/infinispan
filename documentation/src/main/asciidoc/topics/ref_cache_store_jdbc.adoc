= JDBC String-Based Cache Stores
JDBC String-Based cache stores, `JdbcStringBasedStore`, use JDBC drivers to load and store values in the underlying database.

`JdbcStringBasedStore` stores each entry in its own row in the table to
increase throughput for concurrent loads. `JdbcStringBasedStore` also uses a
simple one-to-one mapping that maps each key to a `String` object using the `key-to-string-mapper` interface.

{brandname} provides a default implementation, `DefaultTwoWayKey2StringMapper`,
that handles primitive types.

[NOTE]
====
By default {brandname} shares are not stored, which means that all nodes in the
cluster write to the underlying store on each update. If you want operations to
write to the underlying database once only, you must configure JDBC store as
shared.
====

.Segmentation

`JdbcStringBasedStore` uses segmentation by default and requires a column in
the database table to represent the segments to which entries belong.
