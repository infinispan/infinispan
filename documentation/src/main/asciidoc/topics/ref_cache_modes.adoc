= Cache modes

[TIP]
====
{brandname} Cache Managers can create and control multiple caches that use
different modes. For example, you can use the same Cache Manager for local
caches, distributed caches, and caches with invalidation mode.
====

Local:: {brandname} runs as a single node and never replicates read or write operations on cache entries.

Replicated:: {brandname} replicates all cache entries on all nodes in a cluster and performs local read operations only.

Distributed:: {brandname} replicates cache entries on a subset of nodes in a cluster and assigns entries to fixed owner nodes. +
{brandname} requests read operations from owner nodes to ensure it returns the correct value.

Invalidation:: {brandname} evicts stale data from all nodes whenever operations modify entries in the cache. {brandname} performs local read operations only.
