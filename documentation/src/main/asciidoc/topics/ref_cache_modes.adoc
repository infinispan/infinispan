= Cache Modes

[TIP]
====
{brandname} Cache Managers can create and control multiple caches that use
different modes. For example, you can use the same Cache Manager for local
caches, distributes caches, and caches with invalidation mode.
====


Local Caches::
{brandname} runs as a single node and never replicates read or write operations on cache entries.

Clustered Caches::
{brandname} instances running on the same network can automatically discover
each other and form clusters to handle cache operations.

Invalidation Mode::
Rather than replicating cache entries across the cluster, {brandname} evicts
stale data from all nodes whenever operations modify entries in the cache.
{brandname} performs local read operations only.

Replicated Caches::
{brandname} replicates each cache entry on all nodes and performs local read operations only.

Distributed Caches::
{brandname} stores cache entries across a subset of nodes and assigns
entries to fixed owner nodes. {brandname} requests read operations from owner
nodes to ensure it returns the correct value.

//Community only

Scattered Caches::
{brandname} stores cache entries across a subset of nodes. By default
{brandname} assigns a primary owner and a backup owner to each cache entry in
scattered caches. {brandname} assigns primary owners in the same way as with
distributed caches, while backup owners are always the nodes that initiate the
write operations. {brandname} requests read operations from at least one owner
node to ensure it returns the correct value.
