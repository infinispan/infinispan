Trust store realms use keystores that contain certificates, or certificate chains, that clients must present to connect to {brandname} Server.

If you include the `truststore-realm` element, the trust store must contain public certificates for all clients.
If you do not include the `truststore-realm` element, the trust store needs only a certificate chain to verify client identities.

.Supported authentication mechanisms

Trust store realms work with client-certificate authentication mechanisms:

* **SASL:** `EXTERNAL`
* **HTTP (REST):** `CLIENT_CERT`
