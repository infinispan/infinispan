= Protocol Interoperability
Clients exchange data with {brandname} through endpoints such as REST or Hot Rod.

Each endpoint uses a different protocol so that clients can read and write data in a suitable format. Because {brandname} can interoperate with multiple clients at the same time, it must convert data between client formats and the storage formats.
