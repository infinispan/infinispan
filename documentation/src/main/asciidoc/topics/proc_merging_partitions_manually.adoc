= Manually merging partitions in embedded caches

You can manually search for and resolve conflicting entries when merging embedded caches.

.Procedure

* Retrieve the `ConflictManager` from the `EmbeddedCacheManager` to detect and resolve conflicting entries in a cache, as in the following example:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::code_examples/EmbeddedConflictManager.java[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Although the `ConflictManager::getConflicts` stream is processed per entry, the underlying spliterator lazily loads cache entries on a per segment basis.
