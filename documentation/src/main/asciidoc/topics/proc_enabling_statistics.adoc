= Enabling {brandname} Statistics
{brandname} lets you enable statistics for Cache Managers and caches. However,
enabling statistics for a Cache Manager does not enable statistics for the
caches that it controls. You must explicitly enable statistics for your caches.

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} server enables statistics for Cache Managers by default.
