= Starting and Stopping {brandname} Endpoints
Use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) to start and stop {brandname} endpoint connectors.

Commands to start and stop endpoint connectors:

* Apply to individual endpoints. To stop or start all endpoint connectors, you must run the command on each endpoint connector.
* Take effect on single nodes only (not cluster-wide).

.Procedure

. Start the CLI and connect to {brandname}.
. List the endpoint connectors in the `datagrid-infinispan-endpoint`
subsystem, as follows:
+
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] ls subsystem=datagrid-infinispan-endpoint
hotrod-connector     memcached-connector  rest-connector       router-connector
----
+
. Navigate to the endpoint connector you want to start or stop, for example:
+
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] cd subsystem=datagrid-infinispan-endpoint

[standalone@localhost:9990 subsystem=datagrid-infinispan-endpoint] cd rest-connector=rest-connector
----
. Use the `:stop-connector` and `:start-connector` commands as appropriate.
+
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 rest-connector=rest-connector] :stop-connector
{"outcome" => "success"}

[standalone@localhost:9990 rest-connector=rest-connector] :start-connector
{"outcome" => "success"}
----
