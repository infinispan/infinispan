= Request Balancing
Clients that use topology-aware intelligence use request balancing for all
requests. The default balancing strategy is round-robin, so topology-aware
clients always send requests to servers in round-robin order.

For example, `s1`, `s2`, `s3` are servers in a {brandname} cluster. Clients
perform request balancing as follows:

Clients that use distribution-aware intelligence use request balancing only
for failed requests. When requests fail, distribution-aware clients retry the
request on the next available server.

.Custom balancing policies
You can implement link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/client/hotrod/FailoverRequestBalancingStrategy.html[FailoverRequestBalancingStrategy] and specify your class in your
`hotrod-client.properties` configuration.
