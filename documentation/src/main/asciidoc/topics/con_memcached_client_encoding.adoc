= Client Encoding

The Memcached text protocol assumes data values read and written by clients are raw bytes. The support for type negotiation will come
with link:https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped#data-types[the Memcached binary protocol] implementation.

It's not possible for a Memcached client to negotiate the data type to obtain data from the server or send data in different formats. The server can optionally be configured to handle values encoded with a certain Media Type. By setting the `client-encoding` attribute in the `memcached-connector` element, the server will return content in this configured format, and clients can also send data in this format.

The `client-encoding` is useful when a single cache is accessed from multiple remote endpoints (Rest, HotRod, Memcached) and it allows users to tailor the responses/requests to Memcached text clients. For more infomarmation on interoperability between endpoints, consult the endpoint interoperability documentation.
