= Client Encoding

The Memcached text protocol assumes data values read and written by clients are raw bytes.

It's not possible for a Memcached client to negotiate the data type to obtain data from the server or send data in different formats. The server can optionally be configured to handle values encoded with a certain Media Type. By setting the `client-encoding` attribute in the `memcached-connector` element, the server will return content in this configured format, and clients can also send data in this format.

`client-encoding` is useful when a single cache is accessed from multiple remote endpoints such as Rest, HotRod, or Memcached. This also allows users to customize the response and request to Memcached text clients. For information about interoperability between endpoints, see the endpoint interoperability documentation.
