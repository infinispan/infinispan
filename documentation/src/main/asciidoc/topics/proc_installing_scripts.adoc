= Installing Scripts
Scripts are stored in a special script cache, named '___script_cache'.
Adding a script is therefore as simple as +put+ting it into the cache itself.
If the name of the script contains a filename extension, e.g. +myscript.js+, then that extension determines the engine that
will be used to execute it.
Alternatively the script engine can be selected using script metadata (see below).
Be aware that, when security is enabled, access to the script cache via the remote protocols requires
that the user belongs to the pass:['___script_manager'] role.
