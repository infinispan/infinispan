= JGroups Subsystem Configuration
The JGroups subsystem configures the network transport and is only required when clustering multiple {brandname} Server nodes together.

The subsystem declaration is enclosed in the following XML element:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/jgroups_subsystem.xml[]
----

Within the subsystem, you need to declare the stacks that you wish to use and name them. The default-stack attribute in the subsystem declaration must point to one of the declared stacks.
