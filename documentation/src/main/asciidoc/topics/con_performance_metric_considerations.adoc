= Performance metric considerations
{brandname} includes so many configurable combinations that determining a single 

formula for performance metrics that covers all use cases is not possible.  

The purpose of the _{brandname} performance considerations and tuning guidelines_ document is to provide details about use cases and architectures that can help you determine requirements for your {brandname} deployment.

Additionally, consider the following inter-related factors that apply to {brandname}:

* Available CPU and memory resources in cloud environments
* Caches used in parallel
* Get, put, query balancing 
* Peak load and throughput limitations
* Querying limitations with data set
* Number of entries per cache
* Size of cache entries

Given the number of different combinations and unknown external factors, providing a performance calculation that meets all {brandname} use cases is not possible. 
You cannot compare one performance test to another test if any of the previously listed factors are different. 

You can run a basic performance test from CLI that collects limited performance metrics. 
You can customize the performance test by parameters, so that the test outputs results that might meet your needs. 
The results from the test can provide you with baseline metrics that you can then use to determine settings and resources for your {brandname} caching requirements. 

Measure the performance of your current settings and check if they meet your requirements. 
If your needs are not met, optimize the settings and then re-measure their performance.
