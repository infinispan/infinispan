= ProtoStream Serialization Contexts
A ProtoStream `SerializationContext` contains Protobuf type definitions for
custom Java objects, loaded from `.proto` schema files, and the accompanying
Marshallers for the objects.

The `SerializationContextInitializer` interface registers Java objects and
marshallers so that the ProtoStream library can encode your custom objects to 
Protobuf format, which then enables {brandname} to transmit and store your data.
