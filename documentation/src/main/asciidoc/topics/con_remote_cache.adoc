[id='remote_caches-{context}']
= Cache Configuration with {brandname} Server
Caches configure the data container on {brandname} Server.

You create caches at run-time by adding definitions based on `org.infinispan`
templates or {brandname} configuration through the console, the Command Line
Interface (CLI), the Hot Rod endpoint, or the REST endpoint.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you create caches at run-time, {brandname} Server replicates your cache
definitions across the cluster.

Configuration that you declare directly in `infinispan.xml` is not
automatically synchronized across {brandname} clusters. In this case you should
use configuration management tooling, such as Ansible or Chef, to ensure that
configuration is propagated to all nodes in your cluster.
