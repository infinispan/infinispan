= Clients and POJOs
Even though {brandname} does not recommend doing so, clients can operate on caches that store unmarshalled POJOs with the `application/x-java-object` media type.

[discrete]
== Hot Rod clients

Hot Rod client marshallers must be available to {brandname} Server so it can deserialize your Java objects.
By default, the ProtoStream and Java Serialization marshallers are available on the server.

[discrete]
== REST clients

REST clients must use either JSON or XML for keys and values so {brandname} can convert to and from POJOs.

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} requires you to add Java classes to the deserialization allowlist to convert XML to and from POJOs.
