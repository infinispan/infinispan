= Restarting {brandname} Clusters
When you bring {brandname} clusters back online after shutting them down, you should wait for the cluster to be available before adding or removing nodes or modifying cluster state.

If you shutdown clustered nodes with the [command]`shutdown server` command, you must restart each server in reverse order. +
For example, if you shutdown `server1` and then shutdown `server2`, you should first start `server2` and then start `server1`.

If you shutdown a cluster with the [command]`shutdown cluster` command, clusters become fully operational only after all nodes rejoin. +
You can restart nodes in any order but the cluster remains in DEGRADED state until all nodes that were joined before shutdown are running.
