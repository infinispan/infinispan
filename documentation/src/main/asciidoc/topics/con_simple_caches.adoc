= Simple caches

A simple cache is a type of local cache that disables support for the following capabilities:

* Transactions and invocation batching
* Persistent storage
* Custom interceptors
* Indexing
* Transcoding

However, you can use other {brandname} capabilities with simple caches such as expiration, eviction, statistics, and security features.
If you configure a capability that is not compatible with a simple cache, {brandname} throws an exception.
