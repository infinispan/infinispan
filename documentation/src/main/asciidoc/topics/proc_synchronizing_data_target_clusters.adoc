= Synchronizing data to target clusters

When you set up a target {brandname} cluster and connect it to a source cluster, the target cluster can handle client requests using a remote cache store and load data on demand.
To completely migrate data to the target cluster, so you can decommission the source cluster, you can synchronize data.
This operation reads data from the source cluster and writes it to the target cluster.
Data migrates to all nodes in the target cluster in parallel, with each node receiving a subset of the data.
You must perform the synchronization for each cache that you want to migrate to the target cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Set up a target cluster with the appropriate {brandname} version.

.Procedure

. Start synchronizing each cache that you want to migrate to the target cluster with the {brandname} Command Line Interface (CLI) or REST API.
+
* CLI: Use the [command]`migrate cluster synchronize` command.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
migrate cluster synchronize -c myCache
----
+
* REST API: Use the `?action=sync-data` parameter with a POST request.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
POST /v2/caches/myCache?action=sync-data
----
+
When the operation completes, {brandname} responds with the total number of
entries copied to the target cluster.
+
. Disconnect each node in the target cluster from the source cluster.
+
* CLI: Use the [command]`migrate cluster disconnect` command.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
migrate cluster disconnect -c myCache
----
+
* REST API: Invoke a DELETE request.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
DELETE /v2/caches/myCache/rolling-upgrade/source-connection
----

.Next steps

After you synchronize all data from the source cluster, the rolling upgrade
process is complete.
You can now decommission the source cluster.
