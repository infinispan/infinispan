= JPA Cache Store
The implementation depends on JPA 2.0 specification to access entity meta model.

In normal use cases, it's recommended to leverage {brandname} for JPA second level cache and/or query cache.
However, if you'd like to use only {brandname} API and you want {brandname} to persist into a cache store using a common format (e.g., a database with well defined schema), then JPA Cache Store could be right for you.

.Things to note
* When using JPA Cache Store, the key should be the ID of the entity, while the value should be the entity object.
* Only a single `@Id` or `@EmbeddedId` annotated property is allowed.
* Auto-generated ID is not supported.
* Lastly, all entries will be stored as immortal entries.

//Exclude segmentation from productized docs.

The JPA cache store does not support segmentation.

== Sample Usage
For example, given a persistence unit "myPersistenceUnit", and a JPA entity User:

.persistence.xml
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/persistence_unit_example.xml[]
----

User entity class

.User.java
[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/PersistenceUserEntityClass.java[]
----

Then you can configure a cache "usersCache" to use JPA Cache Store, so that when you put data into the cache, the data would be persisted into the database based on JPA configuration.

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/PersistenceJpaCacheStore.java[]
----

Normally a single {brandname} cache can store multiple types of key/value pairs, for example:

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/CacheMultipleKeyValuePairs.java[]
----

It's important to note that, when a cache is configured to use a JPA Cache Store, that cache would only be able to store ONE type of data.

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/CacheJpaStore.java[]
----

Use of `@EmbeddedId` is supported so that you can also use composite keys.

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/EmbeddedIdExample.java[]
----

Lastly, auto-generated IDs ﻿(e.g., `@GeneratedValue`) is not supported.
When putting things into the cache with a JPA cache store, the key should be the ID value!

== Configuration

=== Sample Programmatic Configuration

[source,java]
----
include::code_examples/ConfigJpaStore.java[]
----

[options="header"]
|===============
|Parameter|Description
|persistenceUnitName| JPA persistence unit name in JPA configuration ﻿(persistence.xml) that contains the JPA entity class
|entityClass| JPA entity class that is expected to be stored in this cache.  Only one class is allowed.
|===============

=== Sample XML Configuration

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/persistence_jpa_store.xml[]
----

[options="header"]
|===============
|Parameter|Description
|persistence-unit| JPA persistence unit name in JPA configuration ﻿(persistence.xml) that contains the JPA entity class
|entity-class|Fully qualified JPA entity class name that is expected to be stored in this cache.  Only one class is allowed.
