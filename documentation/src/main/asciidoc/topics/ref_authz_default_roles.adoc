[id='authz-default-roles-{context}']
= Default Roles and Permissions
{brandname} includes a default set of default roles and permissions for security authorization.

Default roles and permissions come from the cluster role mapper that associates each role to a permission that authorizes operations on Cache Managers and caches.

[TIP]
====
Use the {brandname} CLI to dynamically edit these roles with the [command]`user role` command.

Run [command]`help user` for command usage examples.
