= Side caching

{brandname} stores data that applications retrieve from persistent storage, which reduces the number of read operations to persistent storage and increases response times for subsequent reads.

With side caches, applications control how data is added to {brandname} clusters from persistent storage.
When an application requests an entry, the following occurs:

. The read request goes to {brandname}.
. If the entry is not in the cache, the application requests it from persistent storage.
. The application puts the entry in the cache.
. The application retrieves the entry from {brandname} on the next read.
