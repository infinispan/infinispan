= Executing code in the grid

The main benefit of a cache is the ability to very quickly lookup a value
by its key, even across machines.
In fact this use alone is probably the reason many users use {brandname}.
However {brandname} can provide many more benefits that aren't immediately apparent.
Since {brandname} is usually used in a cluster of machines we also have features available that can help utilize the entire cluster for performing the user's desired workload.
