= {brandname} ports and protocols
As {brandname} distributes data across your network and can establish
connections for external client requests, you should be aware of the ports and
protocols that {brandname} uses to handle network traffic.

If run {brandname} as a remote server then you might need to allow remote
clients through your firewall. Likewise, you should adjust ports that
{brandname} nodes use for cluster communication to prevent conflicts or network
issues.
