= Memcached Server

The {brandname} server distribution contains a server module that implements the Memcached link:http://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt[text] and link:https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped[binary] protocols. This allows Memcached clients to connect with one or several {brandname} backed Memcached servers. These servers can be standalone like Memcached, where each server acts independently and does not communicate with others. They can also be clustered, where the servers replicate or distribute their contents to other {brandname} backed Memcached servers, providing clients with failover capabilities.

The Memcached endpoint is enabled by default on the single-port endpoint. Memcached client connections will automatically be detected and routed to the internal connector.
