= Hot Rod Transactions
You can configure and use Hot Rod clients in JTA {tx}s.

To participate in a transaction, the Hot Rod client requires the {tm} with which it interacts and whether it participates in the transaction through the {sync} or {xa} interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Transactions are optimistic in that clients acquire write locks on entries during the prepare phase. To avoid data inconsistency, be sure to read about link:#hr_transactions_force_return_value[Detecting Conflicts with Transactions].
