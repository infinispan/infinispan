= Configuring transactions

Data that resides on a distributed system is vulnerable to errors that can arise from temporary network outages, system failures, or just simple human error.
These external factors are uncontrollable but can have serious consequences for quality of your data.
The effects of data corruption range from lower customer satisfaction to costly system reconciliation that results in service unavailability.

{brandname} can carry out ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions to ensure the cache state is consistent.
