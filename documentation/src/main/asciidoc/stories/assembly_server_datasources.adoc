= Configuring {brandname} Server Datasources
Create managed datasources to optimize connection pooling and performance for
database connections.

You can specify database connection properties as part of a JDBC cache store
configuration. However you must do this for each cache definition, which
duplicates configuration and wastes resources by creating multiple distinct
connection pools.

By using shared, managed datasources, you centralize connection configuration
and pooling for more efficient usage.
