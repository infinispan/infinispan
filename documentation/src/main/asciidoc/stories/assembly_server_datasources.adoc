= Configuring {brandname} Server Data Sources
Create managed datasources to connect to databases for optimal connection pooling and performance.

While JDBC cache stores can directly configure connection properties to the database,
doing so for each cache individually wastes resources by creating multiple distinct
connection pools as well as duplicating configuration.
By using shared managed datasources, connection configuration and pooling can be centralized
for more efficient usage.
