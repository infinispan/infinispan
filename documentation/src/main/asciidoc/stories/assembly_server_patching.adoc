= Patching {brandname} Server Installations
Install and manage patches for {brandname} server installations.

You can apply patches to multiple {brandname} servers with different versions
to upgrade to a desired target version. However, patches do not take effect if
{brandname} servers are running. For this reason you install patches while
servers are offline. If you want to upgrade {brandname} clusters without
downtime, create a new cluster with the target version and perform a rolling
upgrade to that version instead of patching.
