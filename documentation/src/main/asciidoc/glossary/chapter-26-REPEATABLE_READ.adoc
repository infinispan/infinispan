==  REPEATABLE READ

 _$$REPEATABLE_READ$$_ is one of two isolation levels the Infinispan's locking infrastructure provides (the other is <<sid-68355197,READ_COMMITTED>> ).  Isolation levels link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_level#REPEATABLE_READ$$[have their origins in database] . 

 In Infinispan, REPEATABLE_READ works slightly differently to databases. REPETEABLE_READ says that "data can be read as long as there are no writes, and viceversa". This avoids the link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_level#Non-repeatable_reads$$[non-repeatable reads] phenomenon, because once data has been written, no other transaction can read it, so there's no chance of re-reading the data and finding different data. 

 However, as indicated in <<sid-68355197,READ_COMMITTED>> article, Infinispan has an <<sid-68355174,MVCC>> model that allows it to have non-blocking reads. Infinispan provides REPETEABLE_READ semantics by keeping the previous value whenever an entry is modified. This allows Infinispan to retrieve the previous value if a second read happens within the same transaction.
