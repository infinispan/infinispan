==  Network partition

 Network partitions happens when multiple parts of a cluster become separated due to some type of network failure, whether permanent or temporary.  Often temporary failures heal spontaneously, within a few seconds or at most minutes, but the damage that can occur during a network partition can lead to inconsistent data.  Closely tied to link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem$$[Brewer's CAP theorem] , distributed systems choose to deal with a network partition by either sacrificing availability (either by shutting down or going into read-only mode) or consistency by allowing concurrent and divergent updates to the same data. 

 Network partitions are also commonly known as a <<sid-68355185>> , after the biological condition of the same name.
