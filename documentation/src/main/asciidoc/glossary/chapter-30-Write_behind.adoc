==  Write-behind

 _Write-behind_ is a cache store update mode. When this mode is used, updates to the cache are asynchronously written to the cache store. Normally this means that updates to the cache store are not performed in the client thread. 

 An alternative cache store update mode is <<sid-68355172>> .
