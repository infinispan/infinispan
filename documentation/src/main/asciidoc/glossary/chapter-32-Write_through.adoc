==  Write-through

 _Write-through_ is a cache store update mode. When this mode is used, clients update a cache entry, e.g. via a Cache.put() invocation, the call will not return until Infinispan has updated the underlying cache store. Normally this means that updates to the cache store are done in the client thread. 

 An alternative mode in which cache stores can be updated is <<sid-68355173>> .
