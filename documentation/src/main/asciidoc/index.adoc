Infinispan's documentation is organized as several individual 'books'.  Each
one can be read independently, however they do reference one another, 
particularly the link:user_guide.html[User Guide].

We hope you find this useful.  Any and all feedback should be directed to the 
Infinispan link:http://www.infinispan.org/forums.html[user forums].

TIP: This is written specifically for Infinispan {infinispan-version}.  While
the majority of it will apply to other versions as well, it is best that you 
reference the version of documentation that corresponds to your version of 
Infinispan.
