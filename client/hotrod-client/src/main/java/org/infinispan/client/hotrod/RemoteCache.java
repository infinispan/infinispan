/**
 * Provides remote reference to a Hot Rod server/cluster. It implements {@link org.infinispan.Cache}, but given its
 * nature (remote) some operations are not supported. All these unsupported operations are being overridden within this
 * interface and documented as such.
 * <p/>
 * <b>New operations</b>: besides the operations inherited from {@link org.infinispan.Cache}, RemoteCache also adds new
 * operations to optimize/reduce network traffic: e.g. versioned put operation.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Concurrency</b>: implementors of this interface will support multi-threaded access, similar to the way {@link
 * org.infinispan.Cache} supports it.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Return values</b>: previously existing values for certain {@link java.util.Map} operations are not returned, null
 * is returned instead. E.g. {@link java.util.Map#put(Object, Object)} returns the previous value associated to the
 * supplied key. In case of RemoteCache, this returns null.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Synthetic operations</b>: aggregate operations are being implemented based on other Hot Rod operations. E.g. all
 * the {@link java.util.Map#putAll(java.util.Map)} is implemented through multiple individual puts. This means that the
 * these operations are not atomic and that they are costly, e.g. as the number of network round-trips is not one, but
 * the size of the added map. All these synthetic operations are documented as such.
 * <p/>
 * <b>changing default behavior through {@link org.infinispan.client.hotrod.Flag}s</b>: it is possible to change the
 * default cache behaviour by using flags on an per invocation basis. E.g.
 * <pre>
 *      RemoteCache cache = getRemoteCache();
 *      Object oldValue = cache.withFlags(Flag.FORCE_RETURN_VALUE).put(aKey, aValue);
 * </pre>
 * In the previous example, using {@link org.infinispan.client.hotrod.Flag#FORCE_RETURN_VALUE} will make the client to
 * also return previously existing value associated with <tt>aKey</tt>. If this flag would not be present, Infinispan
 * would return (by default) <tt>null</tt>. This is in order to avoid fetching a possibly large object from the remote
 * server, which might not be needed. The flags as set by the {@link org.infinispan.client.hotrod.RemoteCache#withFlags(Flag...)}
 * operation only apply for the very next operation executed <b>by the same thread</b> on the RemoteCache.
 * <p/>
 * <b><a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Eviction">Eviction and expiration</a></b>: Unlike local {@link
 * org.infinispan.Cache} cache, which allows specifying time values with any granularity (as defined by {@link
 * TimeUnit}), HotRod only supports seconds as time units. If a different time unit is used instead, HotRod will
 * transparently convert it to seconds, using {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit#toSeconds(long)} method. This might
 * result in loss of precision for values specified as nanos or milliseconds. <br/> Another fundamental difference is in
 * the case of lifespan (naturally does NOT apply for max idle): If number of seconds is bigger than 30 days, this
 * number of seconds is treated as UNIX time and so, represents the number of seconds since 1/1/1970. <br/>
 *
 * <b>Note on default expiration values:<b/> Due to limitations on the first
 * version of the protocol, it's not possible for clients to rely on default
 * lifespan and maxIdle values set on the server. This is because the protocol
 * does not support a way to tell the server that no expiration lifespan and/or
 * maxIdle were provided and that default values should be used. This will be
 * resolved in a future revision of the protocol. In the mean time, the
 * workaround is to explicitly provide the desired expiry lifespan/maxIdle
 * values in each remote cache operation.
