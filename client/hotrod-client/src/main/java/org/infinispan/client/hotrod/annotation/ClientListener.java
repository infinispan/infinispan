    * sending any cache entry created events, the client receives a failover
    * event so that it's aware of the change of node. This is useful in order

    * client building a local near cache and keeping it up to date with remote
    * events might decide to clear in when the failover event is received and
    * before the state is received.
    *
    * If disabled, no state is sent back to the client when adding a listener,
    * nor it gets state when the node where the listener is registered changes.
    *
    * By default, including state is disabled in order to provide best
    * performance. If clients must receive all events, enable including state.
