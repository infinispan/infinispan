To be able to support a wide range of Lucene versions from the same jar and API,
the "Infinispan Lucene Directory" needs to have some components compiled with
different versions of Apache Lucene.

# lucene-v3

The Maven module lucene-v3 includes all code and tests needed to support Apache
Lucene in the versions range 2.4.x up to 3.6.x.
This needs to be compiled with Lucene 3.6.x

# lucene-v4

The module lucene-v4 depends on the lucene-v3 module and adds support for Lucene
4.0 and 4.1, but needs to be compiled having Lucene 4.1 on classpath (excluding
Lucene 3).

# infinispan-lucene-directory

This last module represents the Maven artifact we're generating: the first two
are considered intermediate build output and should not be distributed.

In this module we take the output of the previous two runs and assemble them in
a unique jar, generating in the process things like a single pom.xml and the
necessary support for OSGI. At this stage we also declare a dependency to Lucene 3.6
for backwards compatibility reasons. Lucene 3.6 is also the recommended dependency
as it is the one required by Infinispan Query.
