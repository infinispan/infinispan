            The org.javassist:main module is automatically injected by the current WildFly JPADependencyProcessor;
            this module is necessary for users of the standard Hibernate ORM version included in WildFly,
            but when testing the very latest Hibernate ORM it could be the wrong version.
            We therefore exclude it here from the deployment, and have the custom ORM modules bring their own version.
