/**
 * Interface describing methods of a data container where operations can be indexed by the segment of the key
 * stored in the map. This allows for much more efficient iteration when only a subset of segments are required for
 * a given operation (which is the case very often with Distributed caches).
 * <p>
 * This container has a notion of what segments are currently associated with it and these can be controlled via
 * the {@link #removeSegments(IntSet)} and {@link #addSegments(IntSet)} methods. A segment can be added multiple times
 * and the implementation must be able to handle this. If a write occurs on a segment that is not associated with this
 * container it may ignore the write or it could store it temporarily if needed (additional caching). When segments
 * are removed, an implementation is free to remove any entries that map to segments that aren't associated to this
 * container.
