/**
 * Data Container implementation that stores entries in native memory (off-heap) that is also bounded.  This
 * implementation uses a simple LRU doubly linked list off-heap guarded by a single lock.
 * <p>
 * The link list is represented by firstAddress as the had of the list and lastAddress as the tail of the list. Each
 * entry in the list consists of 28 bytes (3 longs and 1 int), the first long is the actual entry address, the second is
 * a pointer to the previous element in the list, the third is the next pointer and lastly the int is the hashCode of
 * the key to retrieve the lock. The hashCode is required to know which lock to use when trying to read the entry.
