/**
 * One of the key aspects of Infinispan is that it often needs to marshall/unmarshall
 * objects in order to provide some of its functionality.  For example, if it needs
 * to store objects in a write-through or write-behind cache store, the objects stored
 * need marshalling.  If a cluster of Infinispan nodes is formed, objects shipped around
 * need marshalling.  Even if you enable lazy deserialization, objects need to marshalled
 * so that they can be lazily unmarshalled with the correct classloader.
 *
 * Using standard JDK serialization is slow and produces payloads that are too big and
 * can affect bandwidth usage.  On top of that, JDK serialization does not work well with
 * objects that are supposed to be immutable.  In order to avoid these issues, Infinispan
 * uses JBoss Marshalling for marshalling/unmarshalling objects.  JBoss Marshalling is fast
 * , provides very space efficient payloads, and on top of that, allows users to construct
 * objects themselves during unmarshalling, hence allowing objects to carry on being immutable.
 *
 * Starting with 5.0, users of Infinispan can now benefit from this marshalling
 * framework as well, and they can provide their own implementations of the Externalizer<T>
 * interface in order to define, how a particular object type needs to be marshalled or
 * unmarshalled.
 *
 * It's common practice to include Externalizer implementations within the classes that
 * they marshall/unmarshall as public static classes.  To make Externalizer implementations
 * easier to code and more typesafe, make sure you define type <T> as the type of object
 * that's being marshalled/unmarshalled.  You can find plenty of examples of Externalizer
 * implementations in the Infinispan code base, but to highlight one, check the Externalizer
 * implementation for {@link org.infinispan.remoting.transport.jgroups.JGroupsAddress} in
 * {@link org.infinispan.remoting.transport.jgroups.JGroupsAddress.Externalizer}
 *
 * {@link AbstractExternalizer} provides default implementations for some of the methods
 * defined in this interface and so it's generally recommended that implementations extend
 * that abstract class instead of implementing {@link Externalizer} directly.

    * <a href="http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-16198">here</a>.
    *
    * It's highly recommended that maintaining of these identifiers is done
    * in a centralized way and you can do so by making annotations reference
    * a set of statically defined identifiers in a separate class or
    * interface. Such class/interface gives a global view of the identifiers
    * in use and so can make it easier to assign new ids.
    *
    * Implementors can optionally avoid giving a meaningful implementation to
    * this method (i.e. return null) and instead rely on XML or programmatic
    * configuration to provide the Externalizer id. If no id can be determined
    * via the implementation or XML/programmatic configuration, an error will
    * be reported. If an id has been defined both via the implementation and
    * XML/programmatic configuration, the value defined via XML/programmatic
    * configuration will be used ignoring the other.
