/**
 * Extended interface that extends capabilities of writing predefined objects 
 * with the possibility of reading them. Any new externalizer implementations
 * should implement this interface. Implementations are free to write class 
 * information to the wire as they wish. See {@link ReplicableCommandExternalizer} 
 * for an such example.
 * 
 * To add a new {@link Externalizer}, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Create an implementation of {@link Externalizer}.
 * 
 * 2. Add class that {@link Externalizer} implementation marshalls to set in 
 * {@link ConstantObjectTable.MARSHALLABLES}
 * 
 * 3. Annotate the class being marshalled with {@link Marshallable} indicating the 
 * {@link Externalizer} implementation and a unique index number.
