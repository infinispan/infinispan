/**
 * A specialized form of the {@link GenericJBossMarshaller}, making use of a custom object table for types internal to
 * Infinispan.
 * <p />
 * The reason why this is implemented specially in Infinispan rather than resorting to Java serialization or even the
 * more efficient JBoss serialization is that a lot of efficiency can be gained when a majority of the serialization
 * that occurs has to do with a small set of known types such as {@link org.infinispan.transaction.xa.GlobalTransaction} or
 * {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}, and class type information can be replaced with simple magic
 * numbers.
 * <p/>
 * Unknown types (typically user data) falls back to Java serialization.
