    * StreamingMarshaller implementation could potentially use some mechanisms to speed up this startObjectOutput call.
    *  
    * <p>On the other hand, when a call is reentrant, i.e. startObjectOutput/startObjectOutput(reentrant)...finishObjectOutput/finishObjectOutput, 
    * the StreamingMarshaller implementation might treat it differently. An example of reentrancy would be marshalling of {@link MarshalledValue}.
    * When sending or storing a MarshalledValue, a call to startObjectOutput() would occur so that the stream is open and 
    * following, a 2nd call could occur so that MarshalledValue's raw byte array version is calculated and sent across. 
    * This enables storing as binary on the receiver side which is performance gain. The StreamingMarshaller implementation could decide
    * that it needs a separate ObjectOutput or similar for the 2nd call since it's aim is only to get the raw byte array version 
    * and the close finish with it.</p>
