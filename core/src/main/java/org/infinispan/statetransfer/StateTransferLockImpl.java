/**
 * This class implements a specialized lock that allows the state transfer process (which is not a single thread)
 * to block new write commands for the duration of the state transfer.
 * <p/>
 * At the same time the block call will not return until any running write commands have finished executing.
 * <p/>
 * Write commands in a transaction scope don't actually write anything, so they are ignored. Lock commands on
 * the other hand, both explicit and implicit, are considered as write commands for the purpose of this lock.
 * <p/>
 * Commit commands, rollback commands and unlock commands are special in that letting them proceed may speed up other
 * running commands, so they are allowed to proceed as long as there are any running write commands. Commit is also
 * a write command, so the block call will wait until all commit commands have finished.
