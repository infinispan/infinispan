/**
 * A cluster executor that can be used to invoke a given command across the cluster.  Note this executor is not
 * tied to any cache.
 * <p>
 * This executor also implements {@link Executor} so that it may be used with methods such as
 * {@link CompletableFuture#runAsync(Runnable, Executor)} or {@link CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(Supplier, Executor)}.
 * Unfortunately though these invocations do not have explicitly defined Serializable {@link Runnable} or
 * {@link Supplier} arguments and manual casting is required when using a lambda.
 * Something like the following:
 * {@code CompletableFuture.runAsync((Serializable && Runnable)() -> doSomething(), clusterExecutor)}.  Although note
 * that the {@link ClusterExecutor#submit(SerializableRunnable)} does this automatically for you.
 * <p>
 * Any method that returns a value should make sure the returned value is properly serializable or else it will
 * be replaced with a {@link org.infinispan.commons.marshall.NotSerializableException}
