/**
 * EmbeddedCacheManager is an CacheManager that runs in the same JVM as the client.
 * <p/>
 * Constructing a <tt>EmbeddedCacheManager</tt> is done via one of its constructors, which optionally take in a {@link
 * org.infinispan.config.Configuration} or a path or URL to a configuration XML file: see {@link org.infinispan.manager.DefaultCacheManager}.
 * <p/>
 * Lifecycle - <tt>EmbeddedCacheManager</tt>s have a lifecycle (it implements {@link org.infinispan.lifecycle.Lifecycle}) and
 * the default constructors also call {@link #start()}.  Overloaded versions of the constructors are available, that do
 * not start the <tt>CacheManager</tt>, although it must be kept in mind that <tt>CacheManager</tt>s need to be started
 * before they can be used to create <tt>Cache</tt> instances.
 * <p/>
 * Once constructed, <tt>EmbeddedCacheManager</tt>s should be made available to any component that requires a <tt>Cache</tt>,
 * via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface">JNDI</a> or via some other mechanism
 * such as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> framework.
