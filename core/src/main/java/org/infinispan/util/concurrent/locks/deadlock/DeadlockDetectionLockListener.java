/**
 * A listener for lock events.
 * <p>
 * This listener is responsible for initializing the probing mechanism once a lock changes ownership. After receiving an
 * {@link LockState#ACQUIRED} event, the listener starts the deadlock detection algorithm for every lock pending to the same key.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The listener registers to a pending promise, i.e., when a key is not immediately locked. Therefore, once it receives
 * an event, the previous owner has released the lock to the pending transactions. The pending owners must probe the holder
 * after every ownership change to guarantee progress in the deadlock detection. A single key can have multiple listeners attached.
 * </p>
