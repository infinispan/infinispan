/**
 * Listener for view changes.
 * <p>
 * This listener triggers the deadlock detection algorithm after a network partition heals. This procedure is necessary
 * to detect deadlock cycles spanning partitions when nodes can communicate again. Therefore, this listener initializes
 * the deadlock algorithm by probing from the local transactions pending remote locks.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Deadlock cycles are identified by message exchange during operation in the cluster without network partitions. Cycles
 * within a cycle partition are identified even during degraded operation. However, it is impossible to detect cycles during
 * partitions when the cycle is not self-contained since the nodes can't communicate.
