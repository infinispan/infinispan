/**
 * A class that handles restarts of components via multiple threads.  Specifically, if a component needs to be restarted
 * and several threads may demand a restart but only one thread should be allowed to restart the component, then use
 * this class.
 * <p>
 * What this class guarantees is that several threads may come in while a component is being restarted, but they will
 * block until the restart is complete.
 * <p>
 * This is different from other techniques in that: <ul> <li>A simple compare-and-swap to check whether another thread
 * is already performing a restart will result in the requesting thread returning immediately and potentially attempting
 * to use the resource being restarted.</li> <li>A synchronized method or use of a lock would result in the thread
 * waiting for the restart to complete, but on completion will attempt to restart the component again.</li> </ul> This
 * implementation combines a compare-and-swap to detect a concurrent restart, as well as registering for notification
 * for when the restart completes and then parking the thread if the CAS variable still indicates a restart in progress,
 * and finally deregistering itself in the end.
