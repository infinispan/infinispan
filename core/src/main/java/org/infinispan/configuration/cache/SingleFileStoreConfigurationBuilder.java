    * exceeded, entries are removed permanently using the LRU algorithm both
    * from the in-memory index and the underlying file based cache store.
    *
    * So, setting a maximum limit only makes sense when Infinispan is used as
    * a cache, whose contents can be recomputed or they can be retrieved from
    * the authoritative data store.
    *
    * If this maximum limit is set when the Infinispan is used as an
    * authoritative data store, it could lead to data loss, and hence it's
    * not recommended for this use case.
