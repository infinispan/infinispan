    * from the in-memory index and the underlying file based cache store.

    * a cache, whose contents can be recomputed or they can be retrieved from
    * the authoritative data store.
    *
    * If this maximum limit is set when the Infinispan is used as an
    * authoritative data store, it could lead to data loss, and hence it's
    * not recommended for this use case.
