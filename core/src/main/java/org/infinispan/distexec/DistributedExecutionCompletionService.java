 * The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use
 * when processing groups of tasks.
 * <p>
 * This class must be used instead of a {@link ExecutorCompletionService}
 * provided from java.util.concurrent package.  The 
 * {@link ExecutorCompletionService} may not be used since it requires the use
 * of a non serializable RunnableFuture object.  Since a ExecutionService
 * may only be used with serializable request objects, this class must be used
