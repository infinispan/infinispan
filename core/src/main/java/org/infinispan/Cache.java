/**
 * The central interface of Infinispan.  A Cache provides a highly concurrent, optionally distributed data structure
 * with additional features such as:
 * <p/>
 * <ul> <li>JTA transaction compatibility</li> <li>Eviction support for evicting entries from memory to prevent {@link
 * OutOfMemoryError}s</li> <li>Persisting entries to a {@link org.infinispan.persistence.spi.CacheLoader}, either when they are evicted as an overflow,
 * or all the time, to maintain persistent copies that would withstand server failure or restarts.</li> </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * For convenience, Cache extends {@link ConcurrentMap} and implements all methods accordingly, although methods like
 * {@link ConcurrentMap#keySet()}, {@link ConcurrentMap#values()} and {@link ConcurrentMap#entrySet()} are expensive
 * (prohibitively so when using a distributed cache) and frequent use of these methods is not recommended.
 * <p />
 * {@link #size()} provides the size of the local, internal data container only.  This does not take into account
 * in-fly transactions, entries stored in a cache store, or remote entries.  It may also take into consideration
 * entries that have expired but haven't yet been removed from the internal container, as well as entries in the L1
 * cache if L1 is enabled along with distribution as a clustering mode.  See the Infinispan User Guide section on
 * <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN51/Clustering+modes#Clusteringmodes-L1Caching">L1 caching</a> for more details.
 * <p/>
 * Also, like many {@link ConcurrentMap} implementations, Cache does not support the use of <tt>null</tt> keys or
 * values.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Unsupported operations</h3>
 * <p>{@link #containsValue(Object)}</p>
 * <h3>Asynchronous operations</h3> Cache also supports the use of "async" remote operations.  Note that these methods
 * only really make sense if you are using a clustered cache.  I.e., when used in LOCAL mode, these "async" operations
 * offer no benefit whatsoever.  These methods, such as {@link #putAsync(Object, Object)} offer the best of both worlds
 * between a fully synchronous and a fully asynchronous cache in that a {@link NotifyingFuture} is returned.  The
 * <tt>NotifyingFuture</tt> can then be ignored or thrown away for typical asynchronous behaviour, or queried for
 * synchronous behaviour, which would block until any remote calls complete.  Note that all remote calls are, as far as
 * the transport is concerned, synchronous.  This allows you the guarantees that remote calls succeed, while not
 * blocking your application thread unnecessarily.  For example, usage such as the following could benefit from the
 * async operations:
 * <pre>
 *   NotifyingFuture f1 = cache.putAsync("key1", "value1");
 *   NotifyingFuture f2 = cache.putAsync("key2", "value2");
 *   NotifyingFuture f3 = cache.putAsync("key3", "value3");
 *   f1.get();
 *   f2.get();
 *   f3.get();
 * </pre>
 * The net result is behavior similar to synchronous RPC calls in that at the end, you have guarantees that all calls
 * completed successfully, but you have the added benefit that the three calls could happen in parallel.  This is
 * especially advantageous if the cache uses distribution and the three keys map to different cache instances in the
 * cluster.
 * <p/>
 * Also, the use of async operations when within a transaction return your local value only, as expected.  A
 * NotifyingFuture is still returned though for API consistency.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Constructing a Cache</h3> An instance of the Cache is usually obtained by using a {@link org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer}.
 * <pre>
 *   CacheManager cm = new DefaultCacheManager(); // optionally pass in a default configuration
 *   Cache c = cm.getCache();
 * </pre>
 * See the {@link org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer} interface for more details on providing specific configurations, using multiple caches
 * in the same JVM, etc.
