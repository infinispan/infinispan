/**
 * The central interface of Infinispan.  A Cache provides a highly concurrent, optionally distributed data structure
 * with additional features such as:
 * <p>
 * <ul> <li>JTA transaction compatibility</li> <li>Eviction support for evicting entries from memory to prevent {@link
 * OutOfMemoryError}s</li> <li>Persisting entries to a {@link org.infinispan.persistence.spi.CacheLoader}, either when they are evicted as an overflow,
 * or all the time, to maintain persistent copies that would withstand server failure or restarts.</li> </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For convenience, Cache extends {@link ConcurrentMap} and implements all methods accordingly.  Methods like
 * {@link #keySet()}, {@link #values()} and {@link #entrySet()} produce backing collections in that updates done to them
 * also update the original Cache instance.  Certain methods on these maps can be expensive however (prohibitively so
 * when using a distributed cache).  The {@link #size()} and {@link #containsValue(Object)} methods upon invocation can
 * also be expensive just as well.  The reason these methods are expensive are that they take into account entries
 * stored in a configured {@link org.infinispan.persistence.spi.CacheLoader} and remote entries when using a distributed cache.
 * Frequent use of these methods is not recommended if used in this manner.  These aforementioned methods do take into
 * account in-flight transactions, however key/value pairs read in using an iterator will not be placed into the transactional
 * context to prevent {@link OutOfMemoryError}s.  Please note all of these methods behavior can be controlled using
 * a {@link org.infinispan.context.Flag} to disable certain things such as taking into account the loader.  Please see
 * each method on this interface for more details.
 * <p>
 * Also, like many {@link ConcurrentMap} implementations, Cache does not support the use of <tt>null</tt> keys or
 * values.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Asynchronous operations</h3> Cache also supports the use of "async" remote operations.  Note that these methods
 * only really make sense if you are using a clustered cache.  I.e., when used in LOCAL mode, these "async" operations
 * offer no benefit whatsoever.  These methods, such as {@link #putAsync(Object, Object)} offer the best of both worlds
 * between a fully synchronous and a fully asynchronous cache in that a {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} is returned.  The
 * <tt>CompletableFuture</tt> can then be ignored or thrown away for typical asynchronous behaviour, or queried for
 * synchronous behaviour, which would block until any remote calls complete.  Note that all remote calls are, as far as
 * the transport is concerned, synchronous.  This allows you the guarantees that remote calls succeed, while not
 * blocking your application thread unnecessarily.  For example, usage such as the following could benefit from the
 * async operations:
 * <pre>
 *   CompletableFuture f1 = cache.putAsync("key1", "value1");
 *   CompletableFuture f2 = cache.putAsync("key2", "value2");
 *   CompletableFuture f3 = cache.putAsync("key3", "value3");
 *   f1.get();
 *   f2.get();
 *   f3.get();
 * </pre>
 * The net result is behavior similar to synchronous RPC calls in that at the end, you have guarantees that all calls
 * completed successfully, but you have the added benefit that the three calls could happen in parallel.  This is
 * especially advantageous if the cache uses distribution and the three keys map to different cache instances in the
 * cluster.
 * <p>
 * Also, the use of async operations when within a transaction return your local value only, as expected.  A
 * CompletableFuture is still returned though for API consistency.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Constructing a Cache</h3> An instance of the Cache is usually obtained by using a {@link org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer}.
 * <pre>
 *   CacheManager cm = new DefaultCacheManager(); // optionally pass in a default configuration
 *   Cache c = cm.getCache();
 * </pre>
 * See the {@link org.infinispan.manager.CacheContainer} interface for more details on providing specific configurations, using multiple caches
 * in the same JVM, etc.
