/**
 * A {@link Stream} that has additional operations to monitor or control behavior when used from a {@link Cache}.
 *
 * <p>Whenever the iterator or spliterator methods are used the user <b>must</b> close the {@link Stream}
 * that the method was invoked on after completion of its operation.  Failure to do so may cause a thread leakage if
 * the iterator or spliterator are not fully consumed.</p>
 *
 * <p>When using stream that is backed by a distributed cache these operations will be performed using remote
 * distribution controlled by the segments that each key maps to.  All intermediate operations are lazy, even the
 * special cases described in later paragraphs and are not evaluated until a final terminal operation is invoked on
 * the stream.  Essentially each set of intermediate operations is shipped to each remote node where they are applied
 * to a local stream there and finally the terminal operation is completed.  If this stream is parallel the processing
 * on remote nodes is also done using a parallel stream.</p>
 *
 * <p>Parallel distribution is enabled by default for all operations except for {@link CacheStream#iterator()} &
 * {@link CacheStream#spliterator()}.  Please see {@link CacheStream#sequentialDistribution()} and
 * {@link CacheStream#parallelDistribution()}.  With this disabled only a single node will process the operation
 * at a time (includes locally).</p>
 *
 * <p>Rehash aware is enabled by default for all operations.  Any intermediate or terminal operation may be invoked
 * multiple times during a rehash and thus you should ensure the are idempotent.  This can be problematic for
 * {@link CacheStream#forEach(Consumer)} as it may be difficult to implement with such requirements, please see it for
 * more information.  If you wish to disable rehash aware operations you can disable them by calling
 * {@link CacheStream#disableRehashAware()} which should provide better performance for some operations.  The
 * performance is most affected for the key aware operations {@link CacheStream#iterator()},
 * {@link CacheStream#spliterator()}, {@link CacheStream#forEach(Consumer)}.  Disabling rehash can cause
 * incorrect results if the terminal operation is invoked and a rehash occurs before the operation completes.  If
 * incorrect results do occur it is guaranteed that it will only be that entries were missed and no entries are
 * duplicated.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any stateful intermediate operation requires pulling all information up to that point local to operate properly.
 * Each of these methods may have slightly different behavior, so make sure you check the method you are utilizing.</p>
 *
 * <p>An example of such an operation is using distinct intermediate operation. What will happen
 * is upon calling the terminal operation a remote retrieval operation will be ran using all of
 * the intermediate operations up to the distinct operation remotely.  This retrieval is then used to fuel a local
 * stream where all of the remaining intermediate operations are performed and then finally the terminal operation is
 * applied as normal.  Note in this case the intermediate iterator still obeys the
 * {@link CacheStream#distributedBatchSize(int)} setting irrespective of the terminal operator.</p>
