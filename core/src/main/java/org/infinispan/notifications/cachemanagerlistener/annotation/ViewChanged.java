 * This annotation should be used on methods that need to be notified when the cache is used in a cluster and the
 * cluster topology changes (i.e., a member joins or leaves the cluster).
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated with this annotation should accept a single parameter, a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.cachemanagerlistener.event.ViewChangedEvent} otherwise a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.IncorrectListenerException} will be thrown when registering your listener.
 * <p/>
 * Any exceptions thrown by the listener will abort the call. Any other listeners not yet called will not be called,
