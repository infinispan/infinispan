/**
 * This annotation should be used on methods that need to be notified when cache entries are evicted.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated with this annotation should be public and take in a single parameter, a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.event.CacheEntriesEvictedEvent} otherwise an {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.IncorrectListenerException} will be thrown when registering your cache listener.
 * <p/>
 *  Locking: notification is performed WITH locks on the given key.
 * <p/>
 * Any exceptions thrown by the listener will abort the call. Any other listeners not yet called will not be called,
 * and any transactions in progress will be rolled back.
