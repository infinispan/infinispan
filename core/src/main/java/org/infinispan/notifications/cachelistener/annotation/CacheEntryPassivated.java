 * This annotation should be used on methods that need to be notified when cache entries are passivated.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated with this annotation should accept a single parameter, a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.event.CacheEntryPassivatedEvent} otherwise a {@link

 *  <p/>
 *  Locking: notification is performed WITH locks on the given key.

 * Any exceptions thrown by the listener will abort the call. Any other listeners not yet called will not be called,
