/**
 * Available flags, which may be set on a per-invocation basis.  These are provided using the {@link AdvancedCache}
 * interface, using some of the overloaded methods that allow passing in of a variable number of Flags.
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 *    <li>{@link #ZERO_LOCK_ACQUISITION_TIMEOUT} - overrides the {@link Configuration#setLockAcquisitionTimeout(long)}
 *                                                 configuration setting by ensuring lock managers use a 0-millisecond
 *                                                 lock acquisition timeout.  Useful if you only want to acquire a lock
 *                                                 on an entry <i>if and only if</i> the lock is uncontended.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #CACHE_MODE_LOCAL} - forces LOCAL mode operation, even if the cache is configured to use a clustered
 *                                    mode like replication, invalidation or distribution.  Applying this flag will
 *                                    suppress any RPC messages otherwise associated with this invocation.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #SKIP_LOCKING} - bypasses lock acquisition for this invocation altogether.  A potentially dangerous
 *                                flag, as it can lead to inconsistent data.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #FORCE_WRITE_LOCK} - forces a write lock, even if the invocation is a read operation.  Useful when
 *                                    reading an entry to later update it within the same transaction, and is analogous
 *                                    in behavior and use case to a <tt>select ... for update ... </tt> SQL statement.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #SKIP_CACHE_STATUS_CHECK} - skips checking whether a cache is in a receptive state, i.e. is
 *                                          {@link ComponentStatus#RUNNING}.  May break operation in weird ways!</li>
 *    <li>{@link #FORCE_ASYNCHRONOUS} - forces asynchronous network calls where possible, even if otherwise configured
 *                                      to use synchronous network calls.  Only applicable to non-local, clustered caches.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS} - forces synchronous network calls where possible, even if otherwise configured
 *                                      to use asynchronous network calls.  Only applicable to non-local, clustered caches.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #SKIP_CACHE_STORE} - skips storing an entry to any configured {@link CacheStore}s.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #FAIL_SILENTLY} - swallows any exceptions, logging them instead at a low log level.  Will prevent a
 *                                 failing operation from affecting any ongoing JTA transactions as well.</li>
 *    <li>{@link #SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP} - when used with <b>distributed</b> cache mode, will prevent retrieving a remote
 *                                      value either when executing a get() or exists(), or to provide an overwritten
 *                                      return value for a put() or remove().  This would render return values for some
 *                                      operations (such as {@link Cache#put(Object, Object)} or {@link Cache#remove(Object)}
 *                                      unusable, in exchange for the performance gains of reducing remote calls.</li>
 *    <li> {@link #PUT_FOR_EXTERNAL_READ} - flags the invocation as a {@link Cache#putForExternalRead(Object, Object)}
 *                                          call, as opposed to a regular {@link Cache#put(Object, Object)}.</li>
