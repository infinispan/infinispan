    * changes. If this operation fails, the server cannot start because
    * topologies won't include this node, and no more cache operations

    * So, in exceptional use cases such as this, a cluster wide cache update
    * should be positively acknowledged by the other nodes, so that if the
    * data is lost, it can be retransmitted immediately without the need
    * to wait for an extra cluster wide operation to detect the lost message.
