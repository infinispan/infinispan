    * In order to increase performance and achieve better throughput, it's
    * common to use negative acknowledgment protocols to confirm the
    * delivery of messages. The problem with these protocols is that if the
    * last message is lost, it can be difficult to recover it because a new
    * message would need to be sent to find the gap.
    *
    * Some cache use cases might involve storing an entry in a synchronously
    * replicated or distributed cache, and if that store operation fails, the
    * application fails to start. One such example is the Infinispan Hot Rod
    * server. When it starts, the first thing it does is add its endpoint
    * information to a cache which is used to notify clients of topology
    * changes. If this operation fails, the server cannot start because
    * topologies won't include this node, and no more cache operations
    * are attempted.
    *
    * So, in exceptional use cases such as this, a cluster wide cache update
    * should be positively acknowledged by the other nodes, so that if the
    * data is lost, it can be retransmitted immediately without the need
    * to wait for an extra cluster wide operation to detect the lost message.
    * The way to force a particular cache operation to be positively
    * acknowledged is to send this {@link #GUARANTEED_DELIVERY} flag.
    *
    * Note that this is flag is <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> and so there is a high
    * probability that it will be removed in future Infinispan versions.
