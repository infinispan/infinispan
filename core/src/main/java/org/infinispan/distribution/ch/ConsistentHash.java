/**
 * A consistent hash algorithm implementation. Implementations would typically be constructed via a
 * {@link ConsistentHashFactory}.
 *
 * A consistent hash assigns each key a list of owners; the number of owners is defined at creation time,
 * but the consistent hash is free to return a smaller or a larger number of owners, depending on
 * circumstances, as long as each key has at least one owner.
 *
 * The first element in the list of owners is the "primary owner". A key will always have a primary owner.
 * The other owners are called "backup owners".
 *
 * This interface gives access to some implementation details of the consistent hash.
 *
 * Our consistent hashes work by splitting the hash space (the set of possible hash codes) into
 * fixed segments and then assigning those segments to nodes dynamically. The number of segments
 * is defined at creation time, and the mapping of keys to segments never changes.
 * The mapping of segments to nodes does change as the membership of the cache changes.
 *
 * Normally application code doesn't need to know about this implementation detail, but some
 * applications may benefit from the knowledge that all the keys that map to one segment are
 * always located on the same server.
