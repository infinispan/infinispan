/**
 * It manages the order of updates from the primary owner to backup owner.
 * <p>
 * It depends on the cache topology id. The primary owner assigns the sequence number to the backup command and then
 * sends it to the backup owner. In the backup owner, the command awaits until it is its turn to be executed.
 * <p>
 * If the command topology id does not match, it throws an {@link OutdatedTopologyException}.
 * <p>
 * The sequence order starts with 1 and it is per segment based. This allows segments to be updated concurrently.
