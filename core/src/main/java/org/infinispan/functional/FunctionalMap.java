/**
 * Top level functional map interface offering common functionality for the
 * read-only, read-write, and write-only operations that can be run against a
 * functional map asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>Lambdas passed in as parameters to functional map methods define the
 * type of operation that is executed, but since lambdas are transparent to
 * the internal logic, it was decided to separate the API into three types
 * of operation: read-only, write-only, and read-write. This separation helps
 * the user understand the group of functions and their possibilities.
 *
 * <p>This conscious decision to separate read-only, write-only and
 * read-write interfaces helps type safety. So, if a user gets a read-only
 * map, it can't write to it by mistake since no such APIs are exposed.
 * The same happens with write-only maps, the user can only write and cannot
 * make the mistake of reading from the entry view because read operations
 * are not exposed.
 *
 * <p>Lambdas passed in to read-write and write-only operations, when
 * running in a cluster, must be marshallable. One option to do so is to
 * mark them as being {@link java.io.Serializable} but this is expensive
 * in terms of payload size. Alternatively, you can provide an Infinispan
 * {@link org.infinispan.commons.marshall.Externalizer} for it which
 * drastically reduces the payload size. Marshallable lambdas for some of
 * the most popular lambda functions used by {@link ConcurrentMap} and
 * javax.cache.Cache are available via the
 * {@link MarshallableFunctions} helper class.
 *
 * <p>Being an asynchronous API, all methods that return a single result,
 * return a {@link CompletableFuture} which wraps the result. To avoid
 * blocking, it offers the possibility to receive callbacks when the
 * {@link CompletableFuture} has completed, or it can be chained or composes
 * with other {@link CompletableFuture} instances.
 *
 * <p>For those operations that return multiple results, the API returns
 * instances of a {@link Traversable} interface which offers a lazy pull­style
 * API for working with multiple results. Although push­style interfaces for
 * handling multiple results, such as RxJava, are fully asynchronous, they're
 * harder to use from a user’s perspective. {@link Traversable},​ being a lazy
 * pull­style API, can still be asynchronous underneath since the user can
 * decide to work on the {@link Traversable} at a later stage, and the
 * implementation itself can decide when to compute those results.
