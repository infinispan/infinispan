/**
 * BasicCache provides the common building block for the two different types of caches that Infinispan provides: 
 * embedded and remote. 
 * <p/>
 * For convenience, BasicCache extends {@link ConcurrentMap} and implements all methods accordingly, although methods like
 * {@link ConcurrentMap#keySet()}, {@link ConcurrentMap#values()} and {@link ConcurrentMap#entrySet()} are expensive
 * (prohibitively so when using a distributed cache) and frequent use of these methods is not recommended.
 * <p /> 
 * Other methods such as {@link #size()} provide an approximation-only, and should not be relied on for an accurate picture
 * as to the size of the entire, distributed cache.  Remote nodes are <i>not</i> queried and in-fly transactions are not
 * taken into account, even if {@link #size()} is invoked from within such a transaction.
 * <p/>
 * Also, like many {@link ConcurrentMap} implementations, BasicCache does not support the use of <tt>null</tt> keys or
 * values.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Unsupported operations</h3>
 * <p>{@link #containsValue(Object)}</p>
 * <h3>Asynchronous operations</h3> BasicCache also supports the use of "async" remote operations.  Note that these methods
 * only really make sense if you are using a clustered cache.  I.e., when used in LOCAL mode, these "async" operations
 * offer no benefit whatsoever.  These methods, such as {@link #putAsync(Object, Object)} offer the best of both worlds
 * between a fully synchronous and a fully asynchronous cache in that a {@link NotifyingFuture} is returned.  The
 * <tt>NotifyingFuture</tt> can then be ignored or thrown away for typical asynchronous behaviour, or queried for
 * synchronous behaviour, which would block until any remote calls complete.  Note that all remote calls are, as far as
 * the transport is concerned, synchronous.  This allows you the guarantees that remote calls succeed, while not
 * blocking your application thread unnecessarily.  For example, usage such as the following could benefit from the
 * async operations:
 * <pre>
 *   NotifyingFuture f1 = cache.putAsync("key1", "value1");
 *   NotifyingFuture f2 = cache.putAsync("key2", "value2");
 *   NotifyingFuture f3 = cache.putAsync("key3", "value3");
 *   f1.get();
 *   f2.get();
 *   f3.get();
 * </pre>
 * The net result is behavior similar to synchronous RPC calls in that at the end, you have guarantees that all calls
 * completed successfully, but you have the added benefit that the three calls could happen in parallel.  This is
 * especially advantageous if the cache uses distribution and the three keys map to different cache instances in the
 * cluster.
 * <p/>
 * Also, the use of async operations when within a transaction return your local value only, as expected.  A
 * NotifyingFuture is still returned though for API consistency.
