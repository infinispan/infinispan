/**
 * The contract for defining how caches interface with external sources of data, such as databases or filesystems.
 * As the name implies, any method in this class must <b>never</b> block the invoking thread.
 * <p>
 * The first method invoked on this store is {@link #start(InitializationContext)}, which starts the store.
 * Once the returned stage has completed, the store is assumed to be in working state and ready to handle operations.
 * Infinispan guarantees the visibility of variables written during the start method, so you do not need to
 * synchronize them manually unless they are mutated in the normal operations of the store itself.
 * <p>
 * After the store starts, Infinispan uses the {@link #characteristics()} method to query the characteristics of
 * the store. It is highly recommended that this method never change the values it returns after the
 * store starts because characteristics might not be cached. For more information, see {@link Characteristic}
 * and its various values.
 * <p>
 * By default, this interface has only a few required methods. If you implement any of the optional methods,
 * ensure that you advertise the appropriate characteristic for that method so that Infinispan invokes it.
 * If Infinispan is instructed that a
 * characteristic is available and the method is not overridden, an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} will be
 * thrown when trying to invoke the appropriate method. Each {@link Characteristic} defines what methods map to which
 * characteristic.
 * <p>
 * Although recommended, segmentation support in store implementations is optional. Segment parameters are provided
 * for all methods where segment information is required, for example {@link #load(int, Object)} and
 * {@link #publishEntries(IntSet, Predicate, boolean). If your store implementation does not support segmentation,
 * you can ignore these parameters. However, you should note that segmented stores allow Infinispan caches to more
 * efficiently perform bulk operations such as {@code Cache.size()} or {@code Cache.entrySet().stream()}. Segmentation
 * also decreases the duration of state transfers when {@link PersistenceConfiguration#fetchPersistentState()} is enabled,
 * as well as the time required to remove data by segments. To indicate that a store implementation supports segmentation,
 * the {@link Characteristic#SEGMENTABLE} characteristic must be returned by the {@link #characteristics()} method. Store
 * implementations can determine if stores are configured to be segmented if {@link StoreConfiguration#segmented()} is
 * enabled, which is available from the {@code InitializationContext}.
 * <p>
 * Store implementations might need to interact with blocking APIs to perform their required operations. However the invoking
 * thread must never be blocked, so Infinispan provides a {@link org.infinispan.util.concurrent.BlockingManager} utility class
 * that handles blocking operations to ensure that they do not leak into the internal system. {@code BlockingManager} does this
 * by running any blocking operations on blocking threads, while any stages continue on non-blocking threads.
 * <p>
 * This utility class provides different methods that range from equivalents for commonly used methods, such as
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(Supplier, Executor)}, to a wrapper around a {@link Publisher} that
 * ensures it is subscribed and obversed on the correct threads. To obtain a {@code BlockingManager}, invoke the
 * {@link InitializationContext#getBlockingManager()} method on the provided context in the start method.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this store must be thread safe if concurrent operations are performed on it. The one exception
 * is that {@link #start(InitializationContext)} and {@link #stop()} are not invoked concurrently with other operations.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is Experimental and its methods may change slightly over time until it has matured.
