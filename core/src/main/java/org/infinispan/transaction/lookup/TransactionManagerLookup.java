/**
 * Factory interface, allows {@link org.infinispan.Cache} to use different transactional systems. Names of implementors of
 * this class can be configured using {@link Configuration#setTransactionManagerLookupClass}.
 * Thread safety: it is possible for the same instance of this class to be used by multiple caches at the same time e.g.
 * when the same instance is passed to multiple configurations:
 * {@link org.infinispan.configuration.cache.TransactionConfigurationBuilder#transactionManagerLookup(TransactionManagerLookup)}.
 * As infinispan supports parallel cache startup, it might be possible for multiple threads to invoke the
 * getTransactionManager() method concurrently, so it is highly recommended for instances of this class to be thread safe.
