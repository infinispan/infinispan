Infinispan requires 'infinispan-core.jar' as well as all libraries listed in the runtime-classpath.txt file.
The required libraries are located in the 'lib' directory and must be added to your classpath, or
packaged with your deployment.

This distribution also ships with a number of optional modules, in the 'modules' directory.  If you wish to use one or
more of these modules, you will also need the module's jar file and all of its dependencies (listed in the corresponding
runtime-classpath.txt file) to be on your classpath.
