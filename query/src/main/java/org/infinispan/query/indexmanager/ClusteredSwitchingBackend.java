/**
 * Manages the current state of being a "master" node or a node delegating index
 * update operations to other nodes.
 * In a static cluster this would have been a boolean state, but a state machine
 * is modelled here to cope with transitions between:
 *
 * Initialization of a node - still not having enough information on the cluster
 * Becoming a master because of previous master failure / shutdown
 * Forfaiting the master role (useful for cluster merges)
 *
 * The transition to become a master goes via different phases, and at each state
 * the process is reversible. So for example if operations have been put on hold
 * while the node is being upgraded, but then the master election is moved to a
 * different node quickly (cluster startup scenario), the buffered operations
 * will be forwarded to the last backend.
 * A node being forwarded update operations but not being the master anymore,
 * will re-forward the payload to the new master: stability by induction.
 *
 * The solution is rather poor at managing cluster Merge operations, but we
 * need to build on upcoming functionality from Infinispan core for that; for
 * example the index content wouldn't be consistent either so one would likely
 * need to wipe the index and rebuild it.
 * Also we're dealing with the inherent limitation of a "cluster wide lock"
 * concept not being compatible with sub-groups of nodes in which a new lead
 * might be elected and a lock per group might have been created.
 *
 * A lock cleanup is not too aggressive: in case a stale lock is detected,
 * scheduled work is postponed. This implies that in such situations in which
 * a stale lock needs to be cleaned up, index operations might not be visible
 * to the transaction committer.
 * I've chosen for this option as the lesser evil vs. blocking incoming RPCs,
 * although if the buffer for postponed operations gets filled too quickly,
 * we'll both speed up the lock acquisition and apply backpressure to the clients.
